# Revision Summary — Dr. Chen Editorial Review

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** All changes implemented  
**Outcome:** Publication-ready (final)

## Changes Implemented

### Required Changes (2/2 completed)
1. ✅ **Exercise 3 prerequisite warning** — Added explicit Week 4 prerequisite note
2. ✅ **Fubini preview specificity** — Enhanced with two named counterexamples, cross-reference to Exercise 2(b)

### Strongly Recommended (3/3 completed)
3. ✅ **Remark 2.8 relocation** — Moved Borel convention before Theorem 2.3
4. ✅ **Code comment enhancement** — Added equation references ([Equation 2.1], [Equation 2.3], etc.)
5. ✅ **Exercise 2(c) disambiguation** — Distinguished well-definedness from convergence

### Minor Corrections (3/3 completed)
6. ✅ **Conditional product notation** — Changed $\otimes$ to $\cdot$ (conditional product)
7. ✅ **Forward reference** — Added Week 4 disintegration theorem reference in Exercise 3
8. ✅ **Figure path** — Changed to `Week_2/tonelli_verification.png`

## All Strengths Preserved

Dr. Chen identified 7 key strengths — all preserved intact:
- Motivation section (algorithmic framing)
- Three-step proof structure
- Example 2.3 (concrete computation + Python)
- Exercise 1(c) (independence connection)
- Open Question 1 (honest theory-practice gap)
- Exercise 2(b) (signed counterexample)
- Algorithmic detail (operational guidance)

## Decision: Code Section Remains in Main Text

Dr. Chen suggested potentially moving Example 2.3 to appendix to hit 90-min target (current: ~128 min).

**Decision:** Keep in main text
**Rationale:** Falls within acceptable 2.5-hour range; praised as "gold standard for Friday code synthesis"; integral to building intuition

## Reviewer's Final Assessment

> "This is high-quality mathematical pedagogy that successfully integrates rigorous measure theory with practical RL applications... Implement the 2 required changes... and this material is publication-ready."

**Grade:** A (Exceptional pedagogy, publication-quality rigor, clear RL connections)

**Benchmark:** Meets or exceeds Brezis/Folland standards

**All feedback incorporated. Material ready for Week_2/final/ directory.**
