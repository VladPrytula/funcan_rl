## I. Critical Issues Addressed

### **Critical Issue 1: Incomplete Proof of Young's Inequality**

**Problem identified (Review lines 32-54):**
- Proof 1 (elementary calculus approach) was abandoned mid-calculation at line 323 with "□ (Proof 1 sketch—full details in Folland §6.2)"
- Algebraic manipulations in lines 273-313 became entangled and were never completed
- Left reader without a complete elementary proof

**Resolution:** **Removed Proof 1 entirely, kept only Proof 2 (convexity/AM-GM approach)**
- **Rationale:** The convexity proof via weighted AM-GM is conceptually cleaner, more generalizable, and already complete
- **Location in revised file:** Section II, lines 229-254 (Day_4_revised_math.md)
- **New note added:** "An elementary calculus proof of Young's inequality exists (minimizing $\psi(a) = a^p/p + b^q/q - ab$), but the convexity approach above is more conceptual and generalizes to other settings. See Folland §6.2 for the calculus proof."

**Impact:** Eliminates incomplete reasoning, provides single authoritative proof, maintains rigor

---

### **Critical Issue 2: Incorrect Variance Bound in Exercise 4 and Remark 2.29**

**Problem identified (Review lines 57-76):**
- Exercise 4 claimed $\text{Var}_\mu[\rho R] \leq \mathbb{E}_\mu[\rho^2] \mathbb{E}_\mu[R^2]$ using Hölder, but this **requires independence assumption** not stated
- Hölder with $p = q = 2$ applied to $\rho^2$ and $R^2$ actually gives: $\mathbb{E}[\rho^2 R^2] \leq \sqrt{\mathbb{E}[\rho^4]} \sqrt{\mathbb{E}[R^4]}$ (fourth moments, not second)
- Solution showed confusion with multiple restarts (lines 310-366 of original)
- Remark 2.29 in main text made the same error

**Resolution:**
**Part A (Exercise 4 revision):**
- **Restructured as three-part exercise:**
  - **(a)** Derive correct fourth-moment bound: $\text{Var}[\rho R] \leq \sqrt{\mathbb{E}[\rho^4]} \sqrt{\mathbb{E}[R^4]}$
  - **(b)** Assuming bounded ratios $|\rho| \leq \rho_{\max}$, derive second-moment bound: $\text{Var}[\rho R] \leq \rho_{\max}^2 \mathbb{E}[R^2]$
  - **(c)** Discuss why clipping reduces variance (PPO, V-trace)
- **Location:** Exercise 4, lines 279-386 (Day_4_exercises_revised_math.md)

**Part B (Remark 2.29 / Remark 2.30 revision):**
- **Corrected to match Exercise 4 structure:**
  - States fourth-moment bound from Hölder first
  - Then derives second-moment bound assuming boundedness
  - Explicitly notes clipping as key to finite variance
- **Location:** Remark 2.30, lines 540-572 (Day_4_revised_math.md)

**Impact:** Mathematically correct application of Hölder, pedagogically sound progression (fourth moments → boundedness → clipping), preserves RL relevance

---

## II. Suggestions Incorporated

### **Suggestion 1: Resolve Anchor Numbering Inconsistency**

**Problem identified (Review lines 81-94):**
- Definition 2.10 labeled `{#DEF-2.4.1}` (Chapter.Section.Number format) but prose uses "Definition 2.10" (Chapter.Number format)
- Inconsistent numbering throughout

**Resolution:** **Adopted Chapter.Number format consistently**
- Changed all anchors to match prose:
  - `{#DEF-2.4.1}` → `{#DEF-2.10}`
  - `{#DEF-2.4.2}` → `{#DEF-2.11}`
  - `{#DEF-2.4.3}` → `{#DEF-2.13}`
  - `{#THM-2.4.4}` → `{#THM-2.5}`
  - `{#THM-2.4.5}` → `{#THM-2.6}`
  - `{#COR-2.4.6}` → `{#COR-2.7}`
  - `{#THM-2.4.7}` → `{#THM-2.8}`
  - `{#THM-2.4.8}` → `{#THM-2.9}`
- **Location:** Throughout main text
- **Consistency check:** Verified against Week 1 numbering convention

**Impact:** Eliminates confusion, matches established Week 1 pattern

---

### **Suggestion 2: Clarify Convention for $p = \infty$**

**Problem identified (Review lines 96-105):**
- Convention $1/\infty = 0$ stated but not explained as a limit

**Resolution:** **Added Remark 2.26**
- **Content:** Explicitly states $1/\infty = 0$ is interpreted as $\lim_{p \to \infty} 1/p = 0$
- Notes consistency with $\|f\|_\infty = \lim_{p \to \infty} \|f\|_p$ (forward reference to Week 3, Day 1)
- **Location:** Remark 2.26, lines 195-197 (Day_4_revised_math.md)

**Impact:** Clarifies limiting definition, prevents student confusion

---

### **Suggestion 3: Name Jensen's Inequality Explicitly**

**Problem identified (Review lines 107-122):**
- Proof 2 of Young uses Jensen (concavity of $\log$) without naming it
- Circular reasoning concern (Jensen not yet covered in syllabus)

**Resolution:** **Named Jensen explicitly with justification note**
- **Added:** "This is **Jensen's inequality** for the concave function $\log$..." (line 242)
- **Justification note:** "(Jensen will be studied rigorously in Week 4, Day 3 when we cover convex functions and conditional expectation; here we use it as background knowledge from undergraduate real analysis.)"
- **Location:** Step 1 of Young's proof, lines 240-244

**Impact:** Avoids circular reasoning, accurately represents prerequisite knowledge, forward-references future coverage

---

### **Suggestion 4: Sharpen Equality Condition in Hölder**

**Problem identified (Review lines 124-138):**
- Equality condition "$|f|^p$ and $|g|^q$ are proportional" could be more explicit

**Resolution:** **Added "equivalently" reformulation**
- **Original:** "...there exist constants $\alpha, \beta \geq 0$ (not both zero) such that $\alpha |f|^p = \beta |g|^q$ $\mu$-a.e."
- **Added:** "**Equivalently,** either $f = 0$ $\mu$-a.e., or $g = 0$ $\mu$-a.e., or the ratio $|f|^p / |g|^q$ is constant $\mu$-a.e."
- **Location:** After Theorem 2.6 statement, lines 406-409

**Impact:** Geometric meaning clearer, alternative formulation aids understanding

---

### **Suggestion 5: [Already addressed as Critical Issue 2]**

---

### **Suggestion 6: Justify Convexity Inequality for Powers**

**Problem identified (Review lines 166-177):**
- Inequality $(a + b)^p \leq 2^{p-1}(a^p + b^p)$ stated without proof (line 574 of original)

**Resolution:** **Added Remark 2.33**
- **Content:** Derives inequality from discrete Jensen: $(\frac{a+b}{2})^p \leq \frac{a^p + b^p}{2}$, then multiply by $2^p$
- Notes that for $p \in (0,1)$, function is concave and inequality reverses
- **Location:** Remark 2.33, immediately after equation (2.22), lines 590-596

**Impact:** No longer assumes non-trivial inequality, maintains rigor

---

### **Suggestion 7: Add Historical Context**

**Problem identified (Review lines 179-189):**
- Mathematical Insight section excellent but missing attribution of key results

**Resolution:** **Added Historical Note paragraph**
- **Content:** Attributes $L^p$ theory to Riesz (1910) and Fischer (1907), Hölder's inequality to Hölder (1889) and Riesz (1910), Minkowski to Minkowski (1896, 1910), and unification to Lebesgue (1902-1910) and Riesz (1910-1913)
- **Location:** After "Mathematical Insight" discussion, lines 718-720

**Impact:** Acknowledges historical development, reinforces classical foundations

---

### **Suggestion 8: Clarify Inclusion Statement for $L^p$ Unit Balls**

**Problem identified (Review lines 191-204):**
- Exercise 5, Observation 4 claims $B_{p_2} \subseteq B_{p_1}$ for $p_1 < p_2$, but this only holds for finite-dimensional/bounded measure spaces

**Resolution:** **Clarified with explicit caveat**
- **Revised Observation 4:** "On $\mathbb{R}^n$ with discrete (counting) measure or Lebesgue measure restricted to a **bounded set** (e.g., $[0,1]^n$)..."
- **Added counterexample:** "However, on **infinite measure spaces** like $(\mathbb{R}, \text{Lebesgue})$, these inclusions fail. For example, $f(x) = \mathbf{1}_{[0,1]}(x)/\sqrt{x}$ is in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ but not in $L^\infty(\mathbb{R})$."
- **Location:** Exercise 5, Observations section, lines 488-502 (Day_4_exercises_revised_math.md)

**Impact:** Prevents overgeneralization, accurate statement of inclusion conditions

---

## III. Strengths Preserved

### **Strength 1: Hölder Proof via Normalization (Lines 398-456 of revised)**
- **Commendation:** "Exemplary proof via normalization... pedagogically excellent"
- **Preservation:** Proof structure kept exactly as is—trivialities, normalization, pointwise Young, integration, substitution
- **Why:** This is the modern standard approach (Folland, Rudin, Stein-Shakarchi) and demonstrates reusable technique

### **Strength 2: Minkowski Proof Completeness (Lines 556-660 of revised)**
- **Commendation:** "Complete and well-annotated proof... pedagogically sound"
- **Preservation:** All four steps retained with explicit algebraic simplification $1 - 1/q = 1/p$
- **Why:** Minkowski is more intricate than Hölder; annotation ensures no hidden steps

### **Strength 3: RL Connections Throughout**
- **Commendation:** "Excellent bridging to reinforcement learning... not afterthoughts—they're integral"
- **Preservation:** All RL applications retained (with Remark 2.30 corrected as per Critical Issue 2)
- **Why:** Central to textbook mission of bridging analysis and RL

### **Strength 4: Example 2.12 (Essential Supremum)**
- **Commendation:** "Concrete example... clearly illustrates why essential supremum differs from pointwise supremum"
- **Preservation:** Example retained exactly as is (lines 155-166 of revised)
- **Why:** Essential supremum is subtle; this example builds intuition

### **Strength 5: Explicit Norm Axiom Verification (Theorem 2.9)**
- **Commendation:** "Explicitly lists all three norm axioms... ensures reader understands nothing is assumed"
- **Preservation:** Theorem 2.9 structure retained (lines 690-710 of revised)
- **Why:** Meta-mathematical summary essential for rigor

---

## IV. Additional Improvements Beyond Review

### **Improvement 1: Time Estimate Transparency**
- **Added note in Agenda:** "**Actual time estimate: 120-150 minutes for dense material (within acceptable range)**"
- **Rationale:** Reviewer noted (line 280 of review) content exceeds 90 min target; documenting this manages expectations per "realistic time constraints" policy

### **Improvement 2: Exercise 3 Replacement**
- **Original:** Exercise 3 duplicated Minkowski proof from main text
- **Revised:** Exercise 3 now asks to prove boundary cases ($p = 1, \infty$) separately
- **Rationale:** Reviewer noted duplication (Minor Observation 2); new version tests understanding without redundancy

---

## VII. Response to Reviewers

**To: Dr. Elena Sokolov, Springer GTM Series Editor**
**From: Prof. Jean-Pierre Dubois**
**Re: Week 2, Day 4 Revision Response**
**Date: October 12, 2025**

---

Dear Dr. Sokolov,

Thank you for your thorough and insightful review of Week 2, Day 4 ($L^p$ Spaces and Fundamental Inequalities). Your feedback has significantly strengthened the mathematical rigor and pedagogical clarity of this material. I am pleased to report that all critical issues have been resolved and all key suggestions have been incorporated.

### **Critical Issues Resolved**

**Issue 1 (Incomplete Young's Inequality Proof):**
I agree that the abandoned calculus proof (original Proof 1) was unsatisfactory. Upon reflection, the weighted AM-GM approach (Proof 2) is indeed more conceptual and generalizable. I have **removed Proof 1 entirely** and added a note directing interested readers to Folland §6.2 for the elementary approach. The revised Section II now presents a single, complete, rigorous proof via convexity.

**Issue 2 (Incorrect Variance Bound):**
You are absolutely correct that my original statement conflated Hölder's fourth-moment bound with a second-moment bound that requires independence or boundedness. This was a significant error. I have:
- Restructured Exercise 4 as a three-part problem: (a) deriving the correct fourth-moment bound $\text{Var}[\rho R] \leq \sqrt{\mathbb{E}[\rho^4]} \sqrt{\mathbb{E}[R^4]}$ from Hölder, (b) showing how boundedness $|\rho| \leq \rho_{\max}$ gives the second-moment bound, and (c) discussing why clipping is essential in practice
- Corrected Remark 2.30 (formerly 2.29) in the main text to match this progression

This now accurately represents both what Hölder guarantees and how practical RL algorithms (PPO, V-trace) mitigate heavy-tailed importance ratios.

### **Suggestions Incorporated**

**All eight suggestions have been implemented:**
1. ✅ Anchor numbering unified (Chapter.Number format: DEF-2.10, THM-2.6, etc.)
2. ✅ Convention $1/\infty = 0$ clarified as limit (Remark 2.26)
3. ✅ Jensen's inequality named explicitly with forward reference to Week 4, Day 3
4. ✅ Hölder equality condition sharpened with "equivalently" reformulation
5. ✅ [Addressed as Critical Issue 2]
6. ✅ Convexity inequality $(a+b)^p \leq 2^{p-1}(a^p + b^p)$ derived via discrete Jensen (Remark 2.33)
7. ✅ Historical note added attributing $L^p$ theory to Riesz, Fischer, Hölder, Minkowski, Lebesgue
8. ✅ $L^p$ unit ball inclusion clarified for bounded sets only, with counterexamples for infinite measure spaces

### **Strengths Preserved**

I am gratified that you found the Hölder normalization proof exemplary and the Minkowski proof complete and well-annotated. These proof structures are central to the textbook's pedagogical approach, and I have preserved them exactly as reviewed. Similarly, the RL connections—bridging abstract analysis to concrete algorithms—remain integral to every major section, now with mathematically correct variance bounds.

### **Additional Improvements**

Beyond your review, I made two enhancements:
1. **Time estimate transparency:** Added a note acknowledging the realistic time estimate of 120-150 minutes (vs. 90 min target) for this dense material, consistent with our "acceptable time constraints" policy
2. **Exercise 3 replacement:** Changed from a duplicate of the main Minkowski proof to a focused exercise on boundary cases ($p = 1, \infty$), addressing your Minor Observation 2

### **Feedback Not Incorporated (with explanation)**

There are no suggestions I declined to incorporate. Your review identified genuine issues and offered consistently sound advice. Where I had initial concerns (e.g., removing Proof 1 of Young), reflection confirmed your judgment was correct.

### **Acknowledgment**

Your feedback exemplifies the rigor and clarity expected of Springer GTM publications. The section on "Critical Issue 2" particularly saved me from propagating a subtle but significant error into student understanding of importance sampling. I am grateful for your expertise.

The revised content is now ready for finalization pending any remaining concerns.

With appreciation,
