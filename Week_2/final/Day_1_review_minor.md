  Overall Assessment

  This section is publication-ready for a Springer Graduate Texts in Mathematics volume or Elsevier textbook series. The mathematical rigor is exemplary, the pedagogical structure is thoughtfully designed, and the RL connections ground abstract theory in modern applications.

  The 2-3 Most Critical Changes Needed

  1. Streamline advanced RL examples (Priority 1): Simplify or defer detailed discussions of:
    - PETS/MBPO model-based RL (Example 2.0, lines 391-396) → Brief mention, defer to Week 40
    - Policy gradient formula derivation (Connection 3, lines 482-489) → State the application without deriving $\nabla_\theta J$
    - DQN replay buffer speculation (Computational Illustration, lines 619-626) → Replace with concise distinction between product vs. policy-induced measures

  Rationale: These are distractions in Week 2 that risk cognitive overload. The RL connections are correct but premature. Deferring maintains rigor while respecting Syllabus pacing.
  2. Reorder Example 2.0 placement (Priority 2): Move the finite product space warm-up (lines 122-128) to immediately after Definition 2.1 (line 117), so examples illustrate definitions rather than preceding them.
  3. Add Syllabus alignment note (Priority 3): At the end of Section VI (Forward Connections, line 690), add:

  Syllabus Alignment Check: This content covers all Week 2 Day 1 objectives (product σ-algebras, semiring structure, uniqueness under σ-finiteness). Anchor Exercise 1 from Syllabus Week 2 ("Prove Tonelli theorem") is addressed tomorrow (Day 2). Time allocation: 40 min reading + 20 min Exercise 1 (semiring) + 10 min Exercise 2 (discrete) + 10 min reflection 
  ≈ 80 minutes, within target 90±30 min range.
