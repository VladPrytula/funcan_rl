**Expected content (from Syllabus.md):** $L^p$ spaces, Hölder's inequality (complete proof via Young), Minkowski's inequality
**Date:** October 12, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

This draft presents a largely **sound and rigorous treatment** of $L^p$ spaces and fundamental inequalities. The mathematical content is correct in its essentials, the proofs are complete (with one notable gap in Proof 1 of Young's inequality), and the pedagogical structure effectively balances rigor with motivation. However, several issues require attention before publication:

**Strengths:**
- Complete, rigorous proof of Hölder's inequality via normalization technique
- Correct and well-structured proof of Minkowski's inequality
- Excellent motivation and RL connections throughout
- Proper handling of boundary cases ($p = 1, \infty$)
- Clear statement of all theorems with explicit hypotheses

**Critical issues:** 2 (proof gap, inconsistent anchor numbering)
**Suggestions:** 8 (notation clarifications, additional examples, sharper statements)
**Commendations:** 5 (proof elegance, pedagogical choices, cross-references)

**Recommendation:** Revise to address critical issues, then approve for finalization.

## I. Critical Issues (Must be addressed before publication)

### **Issue 1 [Section II, Proof 1 of Young's Inequality, lines 232-322]:** Incomplete proof with abandoned calculation

**Problem:** Proof 1 attempts an elementary calculus approach but gets entangled in algebraic manipulations (lines 273-313) and is ultimately abandoned with "□ (Proof 1 sketch—full details in Folland §6.2)" at line 323. This leaves the reader without a complete elementary proof.

**Specific gap:** At line 299, the calculation attempts to verify $\psi(b^{1/q}) = 0$ but encounters messiness with exponents. The text tries multiple substitutions but fails to complete the verification cleanly.

**Required fix:** Either:
1. **Complete Proof 1** by finishing the algebraic verification (recommended approach: use the identity $a^{p-1} = b \Rightarrow a^p = ab$ to show $\psi(b^{1/q}) = a^p/p + b^q/q - ab = 0$ directly), OR
2. **Remove Proof 1 entirely** and present only Proof 2 (convexity), noting that "an elementary calculus proof exists (see Folland §6.2) but we present the more conceptual approach via AM-GM."

**Recommended action:** Complete Proof 1 as follows:

At the critical point $a = b^{1/(p-1)}$ where $\psi'(a) = 0$, we have $a^{p-1} = b$. Then:
- $a^p = a \cdot a^{p-1} = a \cdot b = ab$
- From $1/p + 1/q = 1$, we get $q(p-1) = p$, so $b = a^{p-1} = a^{q(p-1)/q} = (a^{p-1})^{q/(p-1)}$...

Actually, use this cleaner approach: From $a^{p-1} = b$, we have $a = b^{1/(p-1)}$. Since $q = p/(p-1)$, we have $1/(p-1) = (q-1)/q$, so $a = b^{(q-1)/q}$. Then:
$$
a^p = b^{p(q-1)/q} = b^{(p/q)(q-1)} = b^{(p-1)(q-1)/(p-1)} = b^{q-1}
$$

Wait, this is also getting messy. The cleanest fix is to use the substitution $a^p = \alpha$, $b^q = \beta$ from the start. I recommend **removing Proof 1** and noting it exists in Folland.

### **Issue 2 [Day_4_exercises_draft.md, Exercise 4, lines 280-383]:** Imprecise statement and confusion about independence

**Problem:** Exercise 4 claims to prove $\text{Var}_\mu[\rho R] \leq \mathbb{E}_\mu[\rho^2] \mathbb{E}_\mu[R^2]$ using Hölder, but the solution reveals this bound **requires an independence assumption** (line 351) that is **not stated in the problem**. The solution itself acknowledges confusion (lines 305-339) with multiple restarts.

**Mathematical issue:** The bound $\mathbb{E}[\rho^2 R^2] \leq \mathbb{E}[\rho^2] \mathbb{E}[R^2]$ does **not** follow from Hölder's inequality. Hölder gives:
$$
\mathbb{E}[|XY|] \leq \|X\|_p \|Y\|_q
$$
Applied to $X = \rho^2$ and $Y = R^2$ with $p = q = 2$:
$$
\mathbb{E}[\rho^2 R^2] \leq \sqrt{\mathbb{E}[\rho^4]} \sqrt{\mathbb{E}[R^4]}
$$
This is a **fourth moment bound**, not the claimed second moment bound.

**Required fix:** Revise Exercise 4 to either:
1. **State the correct bound from Hölder:** $\text{Var}[\rho R] \leq \mathbb{E}[(\rho R)^2] \leq \mathbb{E}[\rho^4]^{1/2} \mathbb{E}[R^4]^{1/2}$, OR
2. **State the independence assumption explicitly:** "Assuming $\rho$ and $R$ are independent under $\mu$ (which holds when the behavior policy is independent of the reward mechanism), show that $\mathbb{E}[(\rho R)^2] = \mathbb{E}[\rho^2] \mathbb{E}[R^2]$ and conclude the variance bound."

**Pedagogical note:** The confusion in the solution (lines 310-366) suggests the author recognized this issue but didn't revise the problem statement accordingly. The final "Revised solution (acknowledging independence assumption)" (line 349) is the correct approach, but this should be **in the problem statement**, not discovered mid-solution.

## II. Suggestions (Strongly recommended improvements)

### **Suggestion 1 [Section I.A, Definition 2.10, line 116]:** Anchor label inconsistency

**Observation:** Definition 2.10 is labeled `{#DEF-2.4.1}` (suggesting Chapter 2, Section 4, Definition 1), but the surrounding text uses "Definition 2.10" in prose. This creates confusion about the numbering system.

**Recommendation:** Choose **one consistent numbering scheme**:
- **Option A (Chapter.Section.Number):** Use "Definition 2.4.1" in prose and `{#DEF-2.4.1}` for anchors
- **Option B (Chapter.Number):** Use "Definition 2.10" in prose and `{#DEF-2.10}` for anchors

I recommend **Option B** for simplicity, matching the established pattern from Week 1. Adjust all theorem/definition numbers accordingly:
- Definition 2.10 → keep prose, change anchor to `{#DEF-2.10}`
- Definition 2.11 → keep prose, change anchor to `{#DEF-2.11}`
- Theorem 2.5 → keep prose, change anchor to `{#THM-2.5}`
- Theorem 2.6 → keep prose, change anchor to `{#THM-2.6}`
- Etc.

### **Suggestion 2 [Section I.C, Definition 2.13, line 190]:** Clarify convention for $p = \infty$ case

**Observation:** The convention $1/\infty = 0$ (line 194) is standard but should be explicitly stated, as it's a limiting definition rather than a literal arithmetic operation.

**Recommendation:** Add a remark:

**Remark 2.XX (Convention for $p = \infty$).** When we write $1/p + 1/q = 1$ with $p = \infty$, we interpret $1/\infty = 0$ as a limit: $\lim_{p \to \infty} 1/p = 0$. Thus $q = 1$ is the conjugate of $p = \infty$. This is consistent with the limiting behavior of $L^p$ norms: $\|f\|_\infty = \lim_{p \to \infty} \|f\|_p$ (see Week 3, Day 1).

---

### **Suggestion 3 [Section II, Proof 2, line 352]:** Jensen's inequality cited without definition

**Observation:** Line 352 states "This follows from the concavity of $\log$: $\log(\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y) \geq \lambda \log x + (1-\lambda) \log y$, exponentiating both sides." This is Jensen's inequality but not named.

**Recommendation:** Make the reference explicit:

"This is **Jensen's inequality** for the concave function $\log$: for $\lambda \in (0,1)$ and $x, y > 0$,
$$
\log(\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y) \geq \lambda \log x + (1-\lambda) \log y
$$
Exponentiating both sides yields (2.20). (Jensen will be studied rigorously in Week 4, Day 3 when we cover convex functions and conditional expectation.)"

**Justification:** This avoids circular reasoning (we haven't formally covered Jensen yet in the syllabus) and accurately represents the prerequisite knowledge.

---

### **Suggestion 4 [Section III, Theorem 2.6, lines 382-393]:** Sharpen the equality condition

**Observation:** The equality condition (line 393) states "$|f|^p$ and $|g|^q$ are proportional almost everywhere." While correct, this can be made more explicit.

**Recommendation:** Restate as:

**Equality holds if and only if** there exist constants $\alpha, \beta \geq 0$, not both zero, such that:
$$
\alpha |f(x)|^p = \beta |g(x)|^q \quad \text{for } \mu\text{-almost every } x \in X
$$

Equivalently, **either** $f = 0$ $\mu$-a.e., **or** $g = 0$ $\mu$-a.e., **or** the ratio $|f|^p / |g|^q$ is constant $\mu$-a.e.

**Justification:** The "equivalently" reformulation makes the geometric meaning clearer: equality occurs when the functions are aligned in a specific power-law sense.

---

### **Suggestion 5 [Section III, line 526-532, Remark 2.29]:** RL variance bound needs correction

**Problem:** This remark makes the same error as Exercise 4 (see Critical Issue 2), claiming Hölder directly gives $\text{Var}[\rho R] \leq \mathbb{E}[\rho^2] \mathbb{E}[R^2]$.

**Required fix:** Revise to:

**Remark 2.29 (Hölder in RL: Importance Sampling Variance Bounds).** In off-policy RL, the variance of importance-weighted returns satisfies:
$$
\text{Var}_\mu[\rho R] = \mathbb{E}_\mu[(\rho R)^2] - (\mathbb{E}_\mu[\rho R])^2 \leq \mathbb{E}_\mu[(\rho R)^2]
$$

By Hölder with $p = q = 2$ applied to $\rho^2$ and $R^2$:
$$
\mathbb{E}_\mu[(\rho R)^2] = \mathbb{E}_\mu[\rho^2 R^2] \leq \sqrt{\mathbb{E}_\mu[\rho^4]} \sqrt{\mathbb{E}_\mu[R^4]}
$$

If $\rho$ is **bounded** (e.g., via clipping: $|\rho| \leq \rho_{\max}$), we obtain the simpler bound:
$$
\text{Var}_\mu[\rho R] \leq \rho_{\max}^2 \mathbb{E}_\mu[R^2]
$$

This motivates ratio clipping in PPO/V-trace: bounding $\rho$ ensures finite variance even when $\mathbb{E}[\rho^4]$ is large.

### **Suggestion 6 [Section IV, lines 568-577]:** Convexity inequality needs justification or citation

**Observation:** Line 574 claims "$(a + b)^p \leq 2^{p-1}(a^p + b^p)$ for $a, b \geq 0$ and $p \geq 1$" without proof or citation. This is a standard inequality but non-trivial.

**Recommendation:** Add a footnote or remark:

**Remark 2.XX (Convexity Inequality for Powers).** For $p \geq 1$, the inequality $(a + b)^p \leq 2^{p-1}(a^p + b^p)$ follows from the convexity of $t \mapsto t^p$ on $[0, \infty)$ and the discrete Jensen inequality:
$$
\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^p \leq \frac{a^p + b^p}{2}
$$
Multiplying by $2^p$ and rearranging yields the claimed inequality. (For $p \in (0,1)$, the function is concave, and the inequality reverses—see Remark 2.32.)

---

### **Suggestion 7 [Section VI, "Mathematical Insight," line 747-763]:** Add historical context

**Observation:** The discussion of $L^p$ spaces and their geometric structure is excellent but would benefit from attributing key results to their originators.

**Recommendation:** Add:

**Historical note:** The $L^p$ spaces were systematically studied by **Frigyes Riesz** (1910) and **Ernst Fischer** (1907) in their work on Fourier series convergence. Hölder's inequality was proved by **Otto Hölder** (1889) for finite sums; the integral version is due to **Riesz** (1910). Minkowski's inequality is named after **Hermann Minkowski** (1896, 1910) for its connection to the Minkowski functional in convex geometry. The unification under measure theory is due to **Henri Lebesgue** (1902-1910) and **Frigyes Riesz** (1910-1913).

**Justification:** Acknowledges the historical development and reinforces that these results are classical pillars of analysis.

---

### **Suggestion 8 [Exercises, Exercise 5, line 492]:** Clarify inclusion statement

**Observation:** Line 491 claims "$B_{p_2} \subseteq B_{p_1}$" for $p_1 < p_2$, but this is only true for **counting measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$** (finite-dimensional discrete $\ell^p$ spaces). For general measure spaces, the inclusion can reverse or fail entirely.

**Recommendation:** Clarify:

**Observation 4 (Inclusion for finite-dimensional spaces).** On $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the discrete (counting) measure or with Lebesgue measure restricted to a **bounded set** (e.g., $[0,1]^n$), we have:
$$
B_\infty \subseteq B_{p_2} \subseteq B_{p_1} \subseteq B_1 \quad \text{for } 1 \leq p_1 < p_2 < \infty
$$

However, on **infinite measure spaces** like $(\mathbb{R}, \text{Lebesgue})$, these inclusions fail. For example, $f(x) = \mathbf{1}_{[0,1]}(x)/\sqrt{x}$ is in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ but not in $L^\infty(\mathbb{R})$.

## III. Commendations (What works well)

### **Strength 1 [Section III, Hölder's proof, lines 398-456]:** Exemplary proof via normalization

**What works:** The proof of Hölder's inequality using the normalization technique ($F = |f|/\|f\|_p$, $G = |g|/\|g\|_q$) is **pedagogically excellent**. This is the standard approach in modern analysis texts (Folland, Rudin, Stein-Shakarchi) and is presented here with perfect clarity:
1. Trivial cases handled explicitly (lines 401-406)
2. Normalization explained with motivation (lines 408-415)
3. Young applied pointwise (lines 417-422)
4. Integration and use of conjugacy (lines 424-444)
5. Substitution back to original functions (lines 445-456)

**Why it matters:** This proof structure is **reusable** for other integral inequalities (e.g., Jensen, Chebyshev) and demonstrates the power of normalization as a technique.

**Recommendation:** Preserve this proof structure exactly in the final version.

---

### **Strength 2 [Section IV, Minkowski's proof, lines 556-660]:** Complete and well-annotated proof

**What works:** The proof of Minkowski's inequality is complete, correct, and pedagogically sound:
- Step 1 (lines 560-585) verifies $f + g \in L^p$ using the convexity inequality
- Step 2 (lines 587-605) sets up the integral $\int |f+g|^p$ as a product
- Step 3 (lines 607-630) applies Hölder to both terms with careful verification of hypotheses
- Step 4 (lines 633-660) performs the algebraic simplification $1 - 1/q = 1/p$ explicitly

**Why it matters:** Minkowski's proof is more intricate than Hölder's (requiring nested applications), and the annotation here ensures no step is hidden.

---

### **Strength 3 [Throughout, RL connections]:** Excellent bridging to reinforcement learning

**What works:** Every major section includes concrete RL applications:
- Line 54-66: Bellman operators, function approximation, policy gradients
- Line 526-532: Importance sampling variance bounds (though needs correction—see Suggestion 5)
- Line 533-538: Policy gradient bounds via Cauchy-Schwarz
- Line 710-720: Bellman error decomposition
- Line 773-780: Summary of all RL connections

**Why it matters:** This textbook's mission is to bridge pure analysis and RL. These connections are **not** afterthoughts—they're integral to the exposition.

**Recommendation:** After correcting the variance bound (Suggestion 5), these connections are publication-ready.

---

### **Strength 4 [Section I.B, Example 2.12, lines 155-166]:** Concrete example of essential supremum

**What works:** The example of $f(x) = x$ on irrationals, $f(x) = 2$ on rationals clearly illustrates why essential supremum differs from pointwise supremum. The calculation is correct:
- Pointwise $\sup f = 2$ (achieved on rationals)
- Essential $\sup f = 1$ (since $\{f = 2\}$ has measure zero)

**Why it matters:** The essential supremum is a subtle concept, and concrete examples are essential for intuition.

---

### **Strength 5 [Section V, Theorem 2.9, lines 726-740]:** Explicit verification of norm axioms

**What works:** Theorem 2.9 explicitly lists all three norm axioms and indicates where each is proven:
1. Positivity: Immediate from $\int |f|^p \geq 0$
2. Homogeneity: Remark 2.23 (line 130)
3. Triangle inequality: Theorem 2.8 (Minkowski)

**Why it matters:** This meta-mathematical summary ensures the reader understands that all axioms have been verified—nothing is assumed.

---

## IV. Minor Observations (No action required, but note for future)

1. **Notation:** The use of both $\mu\text{-a.e.}$ (line 145) and "$\mu$-almost everywhere" (line 393) is inconsistent. Choose one for the final version. (Standard: "$\mu$-a.e." in formulas, "almost everywhere" in prose.)

2. **Exercise 3 in exercises file (Minkowski proof):** This duplicates the proof from the main text. Consider replacing with a **different** exercise (e.g., "Prove Minkowski for $p = \infty$ and $p = 1$ as special cases" or "Show Minkowski fails for $p = 1/2$").

3. **Equation numbering:** Equations are numbered (2.15), (2.16), etc., but not all referenced equations are numbered. For consistency, number all equations that are referenced in the text. Unnumbered display equations are fine if not referenced.

4. **Syllabus alignment:** The Syllabus specifies "Thursday (90 min - extended proof session): $L^p$ spaces, Hölder's inequality (complete proof via Young), Minkowski's inequality." This content **exceeds** 90 minutes for typical readers. Expect 2-2.5 hours for careful study. This is acceptable per the "realistic time constraints" note (90 min target, 150 min acceptable), but document this in the daily note.

## V. Verdict and Recommendations

**Overall assessment:** This is **strong graduate-level mathematics** suitable for Springer GTM publication pending revisions.

**Required actions before finalization:**
1. **Critical Issue 1:** Complete or remove Proof 1 of Young's inequality (recommend removal with citation to Folland)
2. **Critical Issue 2:** Correct Exercise 4 to either state the independence assumption or use the correct Hölder bound with fourth moments
3. **Suggestion 5:** Correct Remark 2.29 (RL variance bound) to match the fix for Exercise 4
4. **Suggestion 1:** Resolve anchor numbering inconsistency

**Recommended improvements (non-blocking):**
- Suggestions 2, 3, 6, 7: Add clarifying remarks (historical context, Jensen citation, convexity justification)
- Suggestion 4: Sharpen equality condition for Hölder
- Suggestion 8: Clarify inclusion of $L^p$ unit balls

**Estimated revision time:** 2-3 hours to address critical issues and implement key suggestions.

**Post-revision:** This content will be publication-ready for Week 2, Day 4 final version.
