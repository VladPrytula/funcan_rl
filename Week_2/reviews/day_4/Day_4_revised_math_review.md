- **Structure:**
  - Step 1: States weighted AM-GM inequality with Jensen justification
  - Step 2: Specializes to λ = 1/p
  - Step 3: Substitutes x = aᵖ, y = bᵍ and simplifies

**Assessment:** ✅ **PERFECTLY PRESERVED** — Rigorous verification of all axioms

---

## IV. New Commendations

### **Commendation 1: Revision Quality and Responsiveness**

**What works:** The revision demonstrates exceptional scholarly integrity:
- Every critical issue addressed with appropriate fix (removal, correction, clarification)
- All suggestions incorporated thoughtfully (not perfunctorily)
- No defensiveness—author acknowledged errors (e.g., variance bound) and fixed them properly
- Additional improvements beyond review (time estimate transparency, Exercise 3 replacement)

**Why it matters:** This is the hallmark of rigorous scholarship—willingness to acknowledge error and improve. The revision cycle worked exactly as intended.

---

### **Commendation 2: Pedagogical Enhancement in Exercise 4**

**What works:** The restructured Exercise 4 is **pedagogically superior** to the original:
- Part (a) shows what Hölder actually guarantees (fourth moments)
- Part (b) shows how additional assumptions (boundedness) strengthen the bound
- Part (c) connects to practical algorithms (PPO, V-trace, AWR)
- Progression from pure math → applied assumption → engineering practice is exemplary

**Why it matters:** Students often conflate "what the theorem says" with "what I wish the theorem said." This exercise teaches the distinction while still arriving at the desired RL application via explicit assumptions.

---

### **Commendation 3: Transparency About Time Constraints**

**What works:** Added note in Agenda (line 6): "**Actual time estimate: 120-150 minutes for dense material (within acceptable range)**"

**Why it matters:**
- Manages student expectations realistically
- Acknowledges that 90-minute target is aspirational for dense proof sessions
- Aligns with documented "realistic time constraints" policy (90 min target, 150 min acceptable)
- Prevents discouragement when material takes longer than syllabus target

This is honest pedagogy—setting achievable expectations without compromising rigor.

---

## V. Minor Suggestions for Further Polish (Non-blocking)

### **Suggestion 1 [Optional]: Notation Consistency for "Almost Everywhere"**

**Observation:** The text uses both:
- "$\mu$-a.e." in some formal statements (e.g., line 146, 292, 366)
- "almost everywhere" in prose (e.g., line 168, 306, 393)

**Recommendation:** For final publication, standardize to:
- **In displayed equations and formal statements:** "$\mu$-a.e."
- **In running prose:** "almost everywhere" (spelled out)
- **In inline math within prose:** "$\mu$-almost everywhere" or "$\mu$-a.e." (either, but be consistent)

**Justification:** This is Springer house style for GTM series. Current usage is mostly correct, but a final pass for consistency would perfect it.

**Impact:** Purely cosmetic, does not affect mathematical content.

---

### **Suggestion 2 [Optional]: Cross-Reference Verification**

**Observation:** The text includes several forward references:
- Line 127: "L² is a Hilbert space, Week 14"
- Line 199: "‖f‖∞ = lim_{p→∞} ‖f‖ₚ (Week 3, Day 1)"
- Line 204: "Duality between Lᵖ and Lᵍ (Week 3, Day 2)"
- Line 625: "Riesz-Fischer theorem (Week 3, Day 1)"

**Recommendation:** When finalizing Week 3 material, verify that these forward references are accurate (correct week/day placement in Syllabus.md). If Week 3 structure changes during writing, update these references.

**Current status:** Based on Syllabus.md review (lines 312-318 of original review), these appear correct, but confirm when Week 3 is written.

**Impact:** Ensures no broken forward references in final textbook.
