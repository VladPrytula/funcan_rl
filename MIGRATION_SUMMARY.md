# Directory Structure Migration - Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Status:** HISTORICAL RECORD - Migration complete

---

## ⚠️ NOTE: This Document is a Historical Record

This file documents the **initial migration to day subdirectories** (2025-10-11).

**A subsequent workflow update** (same day) changed how `/revise` and `/edit-polish` commands work:
- They now output to `revisions/day_X/` with descriptive naming (`_revised_math`, `_revised_all`, `_polished`)
- User manually promotes to `final/day_X/` (no automated writes to `final/`)

**For the current complete workflow, see:**
- `WORKFLOW_MANUAL.md` - Quick daily checklist
- `CLAUDE.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `File_Management_Guide.md` - Detailed file conventions

---

## ✅ COMPLETED

### 1. Core Documentation Updated

#### **CLAUDE.md**
- ✅ Repository Structure section updated with day_X/ subdirectories
- ✅ Directory Organization Rules rewritten with benefits explanation
- ✅ Complete workflow updated (steps 1-16) with new paths
- ✅ Examples use `Week_Y/drafts/day_X/`, `Week_Y/reviews/day_X/`, etc.

#### **File_Management_Guide.md**
- ✅ Typical Daily Content Lifecycle updated (9 steps)
- ✅ Quick Workflow commands updated
- ✅ Directory Organization Rules with benefits
- ✅ Weekly Directory Structure examples (Week 1 legacy, Week 2+ new)
- ✅ Common Tasks section (Adding weeks, Reviewing, Revising)
- ✅ Do's and Don'ts updated for day subdirectories

### 2. Review Agent Personas Updated

All four review commands now write to `Week_X/reviews/day_Y/`:

- ✅ `/review-math` - Extracts day number, creates `reviews/day_Y/`, writes `[filename]_math_review.md`
- ✅ `/review-pedagogy` - Same pattern for pedagogy reviews
- ✅ `/review-rl-bridge` - Same pattern for RL bridge reviews
- ✅ `/review-all` - Writes all reviews to same `reviews/day_Y/` subdirectory

**Updated Logic:**
- Parses file path to extract week number (`Week_2`) and day number (`day_3`)
- Creates `Week_X/reviews/day_Y/` subdirectory if needed
- Writes review output with original filename pattern

### 3. Week 2 Files Migrated

#### **Day 1 (finalized):**
```
Week_2/final/day_1/
├── Day_1_FINAL.md
└── Day_1_exercises_FINAL.md

Week_2/archived/day_1/
├── Day_1_FINAL.md.bak
├── Day_1_FINAL_CITATION_APPLIED.md
├── Day_1_FINAL_CITATION_AUDIT.md
└── Day_1_review_minor.md
```

#### **Day 2 (finalized):**
```
Week_2/final/day_2/
├── Day_2_FINAL.md
└── Day_2_exercises_FINAL.md
```

#### **Day 3 (in revision):**
```
Week_2/reviews/day_3/
├── Day_3_REVISED_math_review.md
├── Day_3_REVISION_LOG.md
└── Day_3_draft_math_review.md

Week_2/revisions/day_3/
├── Day_3_REVISED.md
└── Day_3_exercises_REVISED.md
```

### 4. Migration Checklist Created

- ✅ `MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Complete documentation of:
  - Old vs. new structure comparison
  - Files updated
  - Migration plan for Week 2
  - Testing plan
  - Rollback procedure

---

## ⏳ OPTIONAL (Nice-to-have, not blocking)

These files have references to paths but are **not actively used** in the daily workflow. Update when convenient:

### 1. **agent.md**
- Current status: May have example paths in Professor Dubois persona
- Impact: Low (examples only, not used programmatically)
- Action: Search for `Week_X/drafts/`, `Week_X/reviews/` and update to include `day_Y/` when found

### 2. **Best_Practices_and_Pitfalls.md**
- Current status: May have path examples in pitfall descriptions
- Impact: Low (documentation only)
- Action: Update examples to use day subdirectories

### 3. **Slash Commands (Lower Priority)**

These may need updates but are less critical:

#### `/revise` command
- Current behavior: Looks for reviews
- Needed: Update to look in `reviews/day_Y/`
- Priority: Medium (if you use this command frequently)

#### `/validate-week`, `/validate-citations`, `/validate-index`
- Current behavior: Likely already handle subdirectories via globbing
- Needed: Verify they traverse `final/day_*/` correctly
- Priority: Medium (test when you run validation)

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

Test the new structure with actual usage:

### ✅ Already Tested (implicitly)
- [x] Creating day subdirectories (Week 2 migration successful)
- [x] Moving files preserves content
- [x] Review commands updated successfully

### 🔄 Test When Next Used
- [ ] Run `/review-math Week_2/revisions/day_3/Day_3_REVISED.md` → Should write to `reviews/day_3/`
- [ ] Create a new day: `mkdir -p Week_2/drafts/day_4` → Write draft → Run reviews
- [ ] Run `/validate-citations Week_2/final/day_1/Day_1_FINAL.md` → Verify works
- [ ] Run `/validate-index Week_2/final/day_1/Day_1_FINAL.md` → Verify works
- [ ] Run `/validate-week 2 all` → Verify finds files in day_X/ subdirectories

---

## 📋 NEW DAILY WORKFLOW (Week 2+)

With the new structure, your daily workflow is now:

```bash
# Day 3 example
mkdir -p Week_2/drafts/day_3
# Create Week_2/drafts/day_3/Day_3_draft.md

# Run reviews (outputs automatically go to reviews/day_3/)
/review-all Week_2/drafts/day_3/Day_3_draft.md

# Create revision
mkdir -p Week_2/revisions/day_3
# Create Week_2/revisions/day_3/Day_3_REVISED.md

# Finalize
mkdir -p Week_2/final/day_3
# Create Week_2/final/day_3/Day_3_FINAL.md

# Cleanup (when done)
rm -rf Week_2/drafts/day_3
rm -rf Week_2/revisions/day_3
```

---

## 🎯 BENEFITS REALIZED

**Before (chaos):**
- `Week_2/reviews/` had 20+ files (5 days × 4 review types)
- Hard to find Day 3's specific reviews
- Cleanup required hunting for files across multiple directories

**After (organized):**
- `Week_2/reviews/day_3/` has only Day 3's reviews
- Mental model: one day = one subdirectory at each stage
- Cleanup: `rm -rf Week_2/drafts/day_3` deletes everything for that day

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (when you continue Week 2):
1. **Finalize Day 3**: Move `revisions/day_3/Day_3_REVISED.md` → `final/day_3/Day_3_FINAL.md`
2. **Test review commands**: Run `/review-math` on Day 3 FINAL to verify output goes to `reviews/day_3/`
3. **Start Day 4**: Use new structure from the beginning (`drafts/day_4/`, etc.)

### When Starting Week 3+:
1. Create week structure with day subdirectories from day 1:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p Week_3/{drafts,reviews,revisions,final,archived}/{day_1,day_2,day_3,day_4,day_5}
   ```
2. Follow updated workflow in CLAUDE.md

### Optional Cleanup:
- Update `agent.md`, `Best_Practices_and_Pitfalls.md` when convenient
- Test validation commands (`/validate-*`) to ensure they handle day subdirectories
- Update `/revise` command if you use it frequently

## 📝 COMMIT RECOMMENDATION

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Restructure Week 2+ with day_X/ subdirectories

Major changes:
- Add day subdirectories (drafts/day_X/, reviews/day_X/, etc.)
- Update CLAUDE.md and File_Management_Guide.md workflows
- Update review agent personas to write to reviews/day_X/
- Migrate Week 2 files: Day 1-2 finalized, Day 3 in revision
- Create MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md and MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md

Benefits:
- Reduced chaos: all Day 3 materials grouped in day_3/
- Mental model alignment: work one day at a time
- Easy cleanup: delete entire day subdirectory when done

Structure applies to Week 2+; Week 1 retains legacy format."
```
