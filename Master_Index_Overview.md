## System Documentation

For detailed information on the index system:

- **[indices/README.md](indices/README.md)** - Complete documentation on:
  - Current single-file vs. future 9-file structure
  - Week-to-phase mapping
  - Slash command updates needed at Week 4
  - Maintenance protocol
  - Migration checklist

---

## For Slash Commands

**Current (Weeks 1-4):**
- Primary index file: `indices/Phase_I_Measure_Theory.md`
- All validation commands point here

**After Week 4:**
- 9 phase files (see [indices/README.md](indices/README.md))
- Commands auto-detect phase from week number
- This file provides cross-phase navigation

---

## Maintenance Notes

**Weekly updates:**
1. Add new results to active phase file
2. Update statistics (by type, status, week)
3. Update alphabetical lookup (add new IDs)
4. Update "Most Referenced" if counts change

**At phase completion:**
1. Verify all syllabus proof targets indexed
2. Final statistics for that phase
3. Archive phase file (no more edits)

**At Week 4 (Phase I complete):**
1. Execute migration plan (see indices/README.md)
2. Create Phase II-IX files
3. Expand this overview with full alphabetical index
4. Update all 6 validation slash commands
