## 🧭 **Global Agenda: Functional Analysis ↔ RL 40-Week Study Plan**

### 🎯 **Main Goal**

Create and actually go through structured, _rigorous yet manageable_ 40-week journey that reconnects the mathematical background (functional analysis, measure theory) with **modern reinforcement learning**, while keeping your daily load to **90 minutes** (Mon–Fri).

Target:

- A **solid theoretical backbone** (measure, Banach/Hilbert spaces, Markov stability, stochastic approximation).
    
- A **portfolio of implemented RL algorithms**, from tabular MDPs to a compact **AlphaZero-lite Reversi project**.
    
- A **library of proofs** and short write-ups that tie analysis ↔ probability ↔ control ↔ RL.

### 🧱 **Structural Layers**

|Layer|Focus|Typical Sources|
|---|---|---|
|1️⃣ **Functional Analysis**|Brezis + Yosida core — Banach/Hilbert, Sobolev, Lax–Milgram, semigroups.|_Brezis, Yosida_|
|2️⃣ **Measure & Probability**|Measure, Lᵖ spaces, convergence theorems, ergodic theorems, concentration.|_Folland, Durrett, Boucheron–Lugosi–Massart_|
|3️⃣ **Markov Chains & MDPs**|Ergodicity, stationarity, value iteration, measurable selection.|_Levin–Peres, Puterman, Meyn–Tweedie_|
|4️⃣ **Reinforcement Learning Theory**|SA/ODE methods, policy gradients, approximation error bounds.|_Bertsekas, Borkar, Lattimore–Szepesvári_|
|5️⃣ **Applied Projects**|Stepwise builds: gridworld → linear TD → bandits → Reversi AlphaZero-lite.|Custom implementations|

---

### 📆 **Execution Model**

- **Daily capsule (Mon–Fri)** → 90 min total (≈ 30 min reading + 30 min proof/exercise + 30 min micro-coding or reflection).
    
- **Weekends** → completely off .
    
- **Dynamic pacing** → slow down on daily tasks; scope remains intact.
    
- **Adaptive structure** → each week’s tasks build directly on the previous ones.

### ⚙️ **Rules**

1. **Weekday capsules** (90 min of curated work).
    
2. **Adjust pacing dynamically**
    
3. **Maintain theoretical coherence** — ensure proofs, code, and readings converge to one conceptual spine.
    
4. **Keep logs and milestones**
