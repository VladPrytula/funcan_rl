## 🎯 **Vision**

**Can you build AlphaZero from first principles?**

Not by importing libraries—but by constructing the complete mathematical foundations: σ-algebras → Banach spaces → Markov chains → MDPs → stochastic approximation → deep RL theory.

This repository documents a **48-week odyssey** from Folland and Brezis to self-play game AI, proving every theorem needed along the way.

### A Personal Note

After many years in industry, building systems and shipping products, I felt a deepening urge to return to something I'd set aside: the **eternal beauty of pure mathematics**. Not as an escape from applicability—but as a way to understand *why* the tools we use actually work.

This journey reconnects two worlds I've lived in: the rigorous abstractions that captivated me during my PhD, and the practical algorithms that power modern AI. It's a bridge built in both directions—honoring the elegance of mathematical structure while never forgetting that these theorems exist because real problems demanded them.

**Target audience:** Anyone who feels this same pull—researchers with strong mathematical background (physics, pure math, engineering) who want to _truly understand_ reinforcement learning, not just run it. Those who've spent years in applied work but hunger for the deeper "why."

## 📚 **What This Is**

A **textbook in the making**, written in real-time as daily study notes transform into publication-quality exposition.

**Three commitments:**

1. **Rigor without compromise:** Every theorem proven, every definition precise, counterexamples for necessity
2. **RL as the North Star:** Every abstraction justified by its necessity in reinforcement learning
3. **Realistic constraints:** 90-minute daily target (up to 2.5 hours for dense material), weekends completely off

**Not another tutorial.** A bridge between:
- **Bourbaki's architectural vision** (build from the ground up)
- **Brezis's pedagogical clarity** (rigorous but readable)
- **DeepMind's algorithmic practice** (code that runs at frontier labs)

## 🎓 **Philosophical Commitments**

### **1. Rigor ≠ Inaccessibility**

*"Rigorous does not mean impenetrable."* — Haïm Brezis

- State theorems with full generality
- Prove in illuminating special cases when pedagogy demands
- Every abstraction is motivated by a concrete RL challenge

### **2. No Orphaned Mathematics**

Every theorem answers: **Why do we need this for RL?**

Examples:
- σ-algebras → observability in MDPs, defining transition kernels
- Banach fixed-point → value iteration convergence
- Dominated convergence → policy gradient interchange

### **3. Code as Proof of Concept**

Every Friday: computational experiments verifying theory
- JAX for autodiff, PyTorch for neural nets
- Production-grade considerations (stability, complexity)
- References to frontier implementations (CleanRL, Stable-Baselines3)

### **4. Intellectual Honesty**

- **Postponed Generalizations Log:** When time constraints force simplifications, we document what's postponed and why
- **Time Constraints:** Target 90 minutes/day, acceptable up to 2.5 hours—over that, we split content
- **Gap Acknowledgment:** Where theory and practice diverge, we say so explicitly
