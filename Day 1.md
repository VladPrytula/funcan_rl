### **Chapter 1: Foundations in Measure and Probability Theory**

#### **1.1 The Structure of Observability: σ-Algebras and Measurable Functions**

**Motivation:** The ultimate ambition of this text is to develop a rigorous mathematical framework for optimal sequential decision-making under uncertainty, a problem epitomized by the modern field of Reinforcement Learning (RL). At its core, this is a problem of optimal control. Whether we are navigating a robot through a dynamic environment or managing a financial portfolio, we must contend with a stream of information from a "state space," which is often a continuum (e.g., $\mathbb{R}^n$).

Before we can speak of probabilities, expectations, or stochastic dynamics, we must first answer a more fundamental question: What constitutes a "reasonable" subset of our state space? If the state of our system is a vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$, can we assign a probability to *any* arbitrary, pathological subset of this space? The answer, a cornerstone of 20th-century mathematics, is no. We must restrict our attention to a well-behaved collection of subsets, those for which concepts like volume, or more generally "measure," are well-defined. This collection is known as a $\sigma$-algebra.

The $\sigma$-algebra, therefore, is the mathematical formalization of **observability**. It defines the universe of events to which we can assign a probability. Consequently, any function that represents a quantity of interest—be it a policy $\pi: \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{A}$ mapping states to actions, or a value function $V: \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}$—must be compatible with this structure of observability. Such functions are termed **measurable**. They are the only functions we can meaningfully integrate to compute expectations, which is the central operation in evaluating and improving policies. This section establishes this fundamental grammar.

---

### **I. Core Theory Part A: σ-Algebras**

We begin by defining the collection of sets that will serve as our domain for assigning probabilities or sizes.

**Definition 1.1 (σ-Algebra).** Let $X$ be a non-empty set. A collection of subsets $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^X$ is a **σ-algebra** on $X$ if it satisfies the following three properties:
1.  (Contains the whole set) $X \in \mathcal{F}$.
2.  (Closure under complementation) If $A \in \mathcal{F}$, then its complement $A^c = X \setminus A$ is also in $\mathcal{F}$.
3.  (Closure under countable unions) If $\{A_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a countable collection of sets in $\mathcal{F}$, then their union $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n$ is also in $\mathcal{F}$.

The pair $(X, \mathcal{F})$ is called a **measurable space**. The elements of $\mathcal{F}$ are called **measurable sets**.

**Remark 1.1 (Immediate Consequences of the Axioms).** The three defining axioms are concise but powerful. Two crucial properties follow directly:
(i) **The empty set is measurable.** From Axiom 1, $X \in \mathcal{F}$. By Axiom 2, its complement $X^c = \emptyset$ must also be in $\mathcal{F}$.

(ii) **Closure under countable intersections.** This property is deduced from the axioms via **De Morgan's laws**. For a collection of sets $\{A_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$, these laws state: $\left(\bigcup A_n\right)^c = \bigcap A_n^c$. To prove closure, let $\{A_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of sets in $\mathcal{F}$. By Axiom 2, each complement $A_n^c$ is in $\mathcal{F}$. By Axiom 3, their countable union $\bigcup A_n^c$ is in $\mathcal{F}$. By Axiom 2 again, the complement of this union, $\left(\bigcup A_n^c\right)^c$, is in $\mathcal{F}$. Applying De Morgan's law, this final set is precisely the countable intersection $\bigcap A_n$.

**Example 1.1 (The Borel σ-Algebra).** For our purposes, the most important measurable space is $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$. The **Borel σ-algebra**, $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$, is defined as the *smallest* σ-algebra on $\mathbb{R}$ that contains all open sets. It contains all sets of practical interest: open, closed, intervals, and countable combinations thereof.

---

### **II. Core Theory Part B: Measures**

With a structure of events $\mathcal{F}$ in place, we can now assign a notion of size to them.

**Definition 1.2 (Measure).** Let $(X, \mathcal{F})$ be a measurable space. A function $\mu: \mathcal{F} \to [0, \infty]$ is a **measure** if it satisfies two conditions:
1.  $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$.
2.  (Countable Additivity) For any countable collection $\{A_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ of pairwise disjoint sets in $\mathcal{F}$,
    $$ \mu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n\right) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mu(A_n) $$

The triple $(X, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ is called a **measure space**.

**Definition 1.3 (Probability Space).** A measure space $(X, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ is a **probability space** if $\mu(X) = 1$. The measure $\mu$ is then denoted by $P$ and called a probability measure.

**Example 1.2 (Lebesgue Measure).** The canonical measure on $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$ is the Lebesgue measure $\lambda$, which generalizes the notion of length. For any interval $(a,b)$, $\lambda((a,b)) = b-a$. Its rigorous construction is a cornerstone of analysis, but we shall take its existence as given.

---

### **III. Classification and Refinement of Measure Spaces**

The applicability of powerful theorems often depends on certain regularity conditions of the measure space. We discuss the most important of these here.

#### **A. σ-Finiteness and Semifiniteness**

These properties relate to whether an infinite space can be understood in terms of finite pieces.

**Definition 1.4 (σ-Finite Measure).** A measure $\mu$ on $(X, \mathcal{F})$ is **σ-finite** if there exists a countable collection of sets $\{E_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} \subseteq \mathcal{F}$ such that $X = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} E_n$ and $\mu(E_n) < \infty$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

The Lebesgue measure is σ-finite, as $\mathbb{R} = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} [n, n+1]$.

**Definition 1.5 (Semifinite Measure).** A measure $\mu$ is **semifinite** if for every set $A \in \mathcal{F}$ with $\mu(A) = \infty$, there exists a subset $B \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $B \subseteq A$ and $0 < \mu(B) < \infty$.

**Proposition 1.1.** Every σ-finite measure is semifinite. The converse is not true.

*Proof.*
(i) **σ-finiteness implies semifiniteness.**
Let $\mu$ be σ-finite, so $X = \bigcup E_n$ with $\mu(E_n) < \infty$. Let $A \in \mathcal{F}$ with $\mu(A) = \infty$. We have $A = \bigcup (A \cap E_n)$. By subadditivity, $\infty = \mu(A) \le \sum \mu(A \cap E_n)$. This implies that for at least one index $n_0$, we must have $\mu(A \cap E_{n_0}) > 0$. Let $B = A \cap E_{n_0}$. Then $B \subseteq A$ and $B \in \mathcal{F}$. Furthermore, $0 < \mu(B) \le \mu(E_{n_0}) < \infty$. This satisfies the definition of semifiniteness.

(ii) **A counterexample to the converse.**
Let $X = \mathbb{R}$ (an uncountable set) and $\mathcal{F} = 2^{\mathbb{R}}$. Define the counting measure $\mu_c(A) = |A|$ if $A$ is finite, and $\mu_c(A)=\infty$ otherwise.
*   **$\mu_c$ is semifinite:** If $\mu_c(A) = \infty$, then $A$ is infinite. Pick any element $x \in A$. The set $B=\{x\}$ is a subset of $A$ with $0 < \mu_c(B) = 1 < \infty$.
*   **$\mu_c$ is not σ-finite:** Assume it were. Then $\mathbb{R} = \bigcup E_n$ where $\mu_c(E_n) < \infty$. This means each $E_n$ must be a finite set. But this would imply $\mathbb{R}$ is a countable union of finite sets, which would make $\mathbb{R}$ countable. This is a contradiction.
$\square$

#### **B. Completeness**

This property refines the σ-algebra to include all subsets of negligible sets.

**Definition 1.6 (Null Set and Completeness).** Let $(X, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ be a measure space.
1.  A set $N \in \mathcal{F}$ is a **null set** if $\mu(N) = 0$.
2.  The measure space is **complete** if for every null set $N \in \mathcal{F}$, every subset $Z \subseteq N$ is also in $\mathcal{F}$.

The Borel measure space $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}), \lambda)$ is famously *not* complete. However, any measure space can be extended to its completion.

**Theorem 1.2 (The Completion of a Measure Space).** For any measure space $(X, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$, there exists a complete measure space $(X, \overline{\mathcal{F}}, \overline{\mu})$ such that $\mathcal{F} \subseteq \overline{\mathcal{F}}$ and $\overline{\mu}$ agrees with $\mu$ on $\mathcal{F}$. The σ-algebra $\overline{\mathcal{F}}$ consists of all sets of the form $A \cup Z$, where $A \in \mathcal{F}$ and $Z$ is a subset of some null set in $\mathcal{F}$.

**Definition 1.7 (The Lebesgue σ-Algebra).** The **Lebesgue σ-algebra** on $\mathbb{R}$, denoted $\mathcal{L}(\mathbb{R})$, is the completion of the Borel σ-algebra $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure $\lambda$. For the remainder of this text, unless specified otherwise, analysis on $\mathbb{R}^n$ will implicitly use this complete space.

#### **1.2 Mappings that Preserve Structure: Measurable Functions**

**Motivation:** Having defined the structure of our state space $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{S}})$, we must now consider the functions that act upon it. In reinforcement learning, the key objects—policies $\pi: \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{A}$, value functions $V: \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}$, and reward functions $R: \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}$—are all functions defined on the state space. For these objects to be compatible with our probabilistic framework, they must respect the underlying structure of observable events. They must be **measurable functions**. A function is measurable if it does not require information that is "finer" than what the σ-algebra provides.

---

### **I. Core Theory: Measurable Functions**

**Definition 1.8 (Measurable Function).** Let $(X, \mathcal{F})$ and $(Y, \mathcal{G})$ be two measurable spaces. A function $f: X \to Y$ is said to be **$(\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{G})$-measurable** if the preimage of every measurable set in $Y$ is a measurable set in $X$:
$$ \forall B \in \mathcal{G}, \quad f^{-1}(B) = \{x \in X \mid f(x) \in B\} \in \mathcal{F} $$
For a real-valued function $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$, we assume the codomain is $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$.

---

### **II. Key Properties & Proofs**

The class of measurable functions is remarkably stable under common operations.

**Proposition 1.3 (Closure under Arithmetic Operations).** Let $f, g: (X, \mathcal{F}) \to (\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$ be measurable. Then the sum $f+g$ and product $f \cdot g$ are measurable.

*Proof.*
(i) **Sum:** To show $f+g$ is measurable, we show $\{x \mid f(x)+g(x) < a\} \in \mathcal{F}$ for any $a \in \mathbb{R}$. The condition $f(x) < a - g(x)$ can be "split" using the dense set of rationals $\mathbb{Q}$.
$$ \{x \mid f(x) + g(x) < a\} = \bigcup_{q \in \mathbb{Q}} (\{x \mid f(x) < q\} \cap \{x \mid g(x) < a-q\}) $$
For each rational $q$, the two sets in the intersection are measurable by the definition of measurability for $f$ and $g$. The intersection is thus measurable. The result is a countable union of measurable sets, which is measurable.

(ii) **Product:** We first note that $f^2$ is measurable, since for $a \ge 0$, $\{x \mid f(x)^2 < a\} = \{x \mid f(x) > -\sqrt{a}\} \cap \{x \mid f(x) < \sqrt{a}\}$, which is an intersection of measurable sets. The product then follows from the identity $f \cdot g = \frac{1}{2}((f+g)^2 - f^2 - g^2)$. As $f+g$ is measurable, its square is measurable. The expression is a linear combination of measurable functions, and is therefore measurable.
$\square$

**Proposition 1.4 (Closure under Composition).** Let $g: (X, \mathcal{F}) \to (\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$ be measurable and $f: (\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})) \to (\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$ be continuous. Then the composition $f \circ g$ is measurable.

*Proof.* We must show that for any open set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $(f \circ g)^{-1}(A) \in \mathcal{F}$. By definition, $(f \circ g)^{-1}(A) = g^{-1}(f^{-1}(A))$. Since $f$ is continuous, the preimage $f^{-1}(A)$ of an open set is open. Open sets are in $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$. As $g$ is measurable, the preimage of this Borel set, $g^{-1}(f^{-1}(A))$, must be in $\mathcal{F}$. This suffices to prove measurability.
$\square$

The property of completeness has a vital consequence for measurable functions.

**Proposition 1.5 (Measurability of "Almost Everywhere" Equal Functions).** Let $(X, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ be a **complete** measure space. If $f:X \to \mathbb{R}$ is measurable and $g:X \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfies $f(x)=g(x)$ for all $x$ outside a null set, then $g$ is also measurable.

*Proof.* Let $N \in \mathcal{F}$ be a null set such that $E = \{x \mid f(x) \neq g(x)\} \subseteq N$. As the space is complete, $E \in \mathcal{F}$ and $\mu(E)=0$. For any $a \in \mathbb{R}$:
$$ \{x \mid g(x) < a\} = (\{x \in E^c \mid g(x) < a\}) \cup (\{x \in E \mid g(x) < a\}) $$
The first term is $\{x \in E^c \mid f(x) < a\} = E^c \cap f^{-1}((-\infty,a))$, which is an intersection of measurable sets and hence measurable. The second term is a subset of the null set $E$. By completeness, it is also measurable. The union of two measurable sets is measurable. Thus, $g$ is measurable.
$\square$

---

### **III. Computational Illustration: The Intricacy of Measurable Sets**

Measurability extends far beyond simple sets. The **Cantor function**, $f_c: [0, 1] \to [0, 1]$, provides a stunning example. It is continuous (and thus measurable) but reveals that preimages can have a complex, fractal structure.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def cantor_function(x, n=10):
    if n == 0 or x <= 0: return 0
    if x >= 1: return 1
    if 0 < x < 1/3: return 0.5 * cantor_function(3 * x, n - 1)
    elif 1/3 <= x <= 2/3: return 0.5
    else: return 0.5 + 0.5 * cantor_function(3 * x - 2, n - 1)

x_domain = np.linspace(0, 1, 2000)
y_values = np.vectorize(cantor_function)(x_domain)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.plot(x_domain, y_values, color='darkred')
plt.title("The Cantor Function (Devil's Staircase)")
plt.xlabel('Domain $X = [0, 1]$'); plt.ylabel('Codomain $\mathbb{R}$')
plt.grid(True, linestyle=':'); plt.show()
```

**Interpretation:** This continuous function is non-decreasing yet its derivative is zero "almost everywhere"—all of its growth occurs on the **Cantor set**, a Borel set of Lebesgue measure zero. This illustrates that a measurable function can map a simple codomain interval to a domain set of profound topological complexity. Our theory is robust enough to handle such mappings, which is essential for describing the potentially intricate value functions that arise in complex control landscapes.

### **IV. Synthesis: The Language of Markov Decision Processes**

We are now equipped to formally define the foundational model of reinforcement learning. A **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** is a tuple $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, P, R, \gamma)$, where:
*   **$(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{S}})$ and $(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{A}})$ are measurable spaces** for the states and actions. They define the universe of observable events. For $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, we typically use the complete Lebesgue measure space.
*   **The transition kernel $P: \mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{S}} \times \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \to [0,1]$** is a function such that for any fixed state-action pair $(s,a)$, $P(\cdot | s,a)$ is a probability measure on $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{S}})$. This requires $P$ to have certain measurability properties itself, a topic we will return to.
*   **The reward function $R: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a measurable function.** This ensures that the concept of expected reward is well-defined.
*   **A deterministic policy $\pi: \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{A}$ must be an $(\mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{S}}, \mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{A}})$-measurable function.** This is the mathematical embodiment of a physically realizable control law: the choice of action can only depend on observable information about the state.

The properties we have studied are not abstract niceties. The σ-finiteness of the Lebesgue measure is what allows us to analyze systems on unbounded state spaces. The completeness of the measure space is what guarantees that the function spaces $L^p(\mathcal{S})$—the natural home for value functions—are well-behaved, allowing us to state that if two value functions differ only on a set of states with zero probability of being visited, they are for all practical purposes identical.

We have built the static language of states, events, and policies. Our next step is to make this world dynamic. We must develop the theory of integration with respect to a measure, which will allow us to formalize the notion of **Expectation**. This will unlock the door to the Bellman equations, the beating heart of dynamic programming and reinforcement learning.

### Appendix: some reflections:

This is a superb and deeply important question. A lesser student would simply accept the formalism, but to question its necessity is the mark of a true researcher. You are correct to be skeptical. If the bridge between the foundational theory and its application feels artificial, then the exposition has failed in its primary duty.

The link is not at all `tiré par les cheveux`; it is, in fact, the very heart of the matter. The failure is in my exposition, which has merely stated the connection as a fact, rather than demonstrating its profound and inescapable necessity.

Let us rewrite this section. We will replace the previous "Application Bridge" with a more compelling, philosophically grounded argument that reveals *why* the theory is not an optional accessory but the very bedrock of a coherent model of reality.

***

### **IV. Application Bridge: Why Measure Theory is Not Optional**

A pragmatic person, upon encountering the edifice of σ-algebras and measurable functions, might fairly ask: Is this requirement of measurability merely a formalistic flourish, a mathematical "tax" we must pay before getting to the "real" work of algorithms, or does it correspond to a fundamental necessity? Could we not simply consider any arbitrary function $f: \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}$ as a value function?

The answer is an emphatic no. The constraint of measurability is the mathematical formalization of **physical realizability**. To ignore it is to allow for policies and value functions that are not merely complex, but are paradoxical, information-theoretic impossibilities.

Let us illustrate this with a thought experiment.

**The Paradoxical Controller**

Imagine a simple control problem. The state of our system is a single number $s \in \mathcal{S} = [0,1]$. At any state, we can choose one of two actions: $\mathcal{A} = \{\text{Accelerate}, \text{Brake}\}$. A policy is a rule that tells us which action to take for each state $s$.

Now, from the axiom of choice, one can construct truly pathological subsets of $[0,1]$. Let $V$ be such a set—a **Vitali set**, for instance—which is provably **non-measurable** with respect to the Lebesgue measure. This means it is impossible to consistently assign a "length" or "size" to $V$.

Consider the following policy, $\pi^*$:
$$ \pi^*(s) = \begin{cases} \text{Accelerate} & \text{if } s \in V \\ \text{Brake} & \text{if } s \notin V \end{cases} $$
This is a perfectly well-defined function in the set-theoretic sense. But is it a valid policy for a physical system? Let us interrogate it.

Suppose the initial state $s_0$ of our system is drawn from a uniform probability distribution on $[0,1]$. We ask the most basic possible question: **What is the probability that our controller will choose to accelerate?**

The answer should be the measure of the set of states where it accelerates, which is $P(\{s \mid \pi^*(s) = \text{Accelerate}\}) = \lambda(V)$. But $\lambda(V)$ is, by the very nature of a non-measurable set, **undefined**. The question, which ought to be fundamental to any analysis of the system, *has no answer*. Our model of the world has shattered before we have even taken a single step.

**The Deeper Meaning: Information and Observability**

The paradox runs deeper than just undefined probabilities. For a device to implement the policy $\pi^*$, it must be able to determine whether the input state $s$ is an element of the Vitali set $V$. This is tantamount to possessing an infinite amount of information about the number $s$. A physical sensor can only ever perform a finite number of measurements. It can check if $s$ lies in an interval, or a finite union of intervals. Through countable operations, it can at best determine if $s$ belongs to a **Borel set**. It has no physical mechanism to answer the question "is $s \in V$?", a question whose structure is pathologically intermingled with the entire real line.

This is the crucial insight:
> The σ-algebra $\mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{S}}$ represents the set of all questions about the state that a physical observer can answer. A policy $\pi$ is measurable if and only if the decision it makes can be determined by asking a countable sequence of these physically answerable questions.

A non-measurable policy is a fiction. It is a control law that requires access to information about the universe that is physically unobtainable.

Therefore, when we demand that policies, value functions, and reward functions be measurable, we are not engaging in pedantry. We are enforcing a fundamental consistency check that ensures our mathematical models correspond to something that could, in principle, exist in the real world. The entire machinery of Bellman operators, convergence proofs, and policy iteration is built upon function spaces ($L^p$ spaces) which consist *only* of measurable functions, because these are the only functions that represent physically meaningful quantities.

The theory we have just laid out is not a bridge to the application; it is the very ground upon which the application must be built. Without it, we are not doing engineering or science, but wandering in a paradoxical landscape of mathematical curiosities.
