# Émile, Margot, and the Garden of Unmeasurable Things

## Chapter One: The Measuring Tape that Wouldn’t Work

Émile and Margot lived in a peculiar house at the end of a peculiar street in a city that was quite ordinary except for one thing: their garden had a mind of its own.

Not in the way that gardens usually do—with roses climbing where you don’t want them and weeds appearing overnight. No, their garden changed according to rules that seemed almost mathematical, though neither child could quite put their finger on what those rules were.

Émile, who was nine and three-quarters (the three-quarters mattered very much to him), liked to keep a notebook where he recorded everything: the number of stones on the path (247, though this kept changing), the area of the lawn (approximately 34 square meters, though his measurements never quite agreed with themselves), and the exact temperature at which the morning dew evaporated (he was still working on this one).

Margot, who was seven and didn’t care about fractions, preferred to simply *watch* things. She noticed that the apple tree grew taller on Tuesdays. She observed that the garden gate clicked differently depending on the weather. She suspected the garden path rearranged itself when no one was looking, though Émile told her this was “scientifically improbable.”

One Saturday morning, they found something new in the garden.

It sat right in the middle of the lawn, looking for all the world like a pile of glittering dust—except it wasn’t quite dust, and it wasn’t quite glittering, and it certainly wasn’t behaving like anything that should be sitting on their lawn.

“Right,” said Émile, retrieving his measuring tape with the air of someone approaching a Very Serious Problem. “Let’s determine its size.”

He stretched the tape across the mysterious pile.

The tape stopped working.

Not broken, exactly. It simply… refused to commit. The numbers flickered: 5 centimeters, then 12, then 0, then infinity, then a symbol that looked like a shrug.

“That’s odd,” said Émile, which was his way of saying something had completely shattered his understanding of the universe.

“Maybe,” suggested Margot, “it doesn’t *have* a size.”

“Everything has a size,” Émile said firmly. “That’s the whole *point* of things. Things take up space. Space can be measured. Therefore, things can be measured. Logic.” He knocked on the ground as if to emphasize this fundamental truth.

The pile of dust shimmered, and then, to both children’s astonishment, it spoke.

“I’m afraid,” it said in a voice like wind through a mathematical formula, “that I might be unmeasurable.”

## Chapter Two: The Dust That Wasn’t There

“You see,” the Dust explained (for that’s what they decided to call it, though it insisted it was really a Set), “I’m what you might call a *Vitali Set*. I’m made up of points from your garden, but I’m arranged in such a peculiar way that no measuring tape in the universe can tell you my size.”

“That’s ridiculous,” said Émile. “You’re clearly *there*. You’re taking up space on our lawn. That’s some number of square centimeters. It might be very small or very large, but it’s *something*.”

“Is it?” The Dust swirled thoughtfully. “Let me ask you this: how much of your garden can you actually *see*?”

Margot looked around. “All of it?”

“Can you see the space between the grass blades?”

“Well… yes?”

“Can you see the space between the molecules of air?”

“…No.”

“Can you see every single point on your garden path, all infinity of them?”

“That’s impossible,” said Émile. “There are infinitely many points. No one could look at every single one.”

“Precisely!” said the Dust with satisfaction. “You can see *some* things. You can see areas, and shapes, and collections of points that follow nice patterns. You can measure rectangles and circles and even rather complicated curvy things. But you can’t see or measure *everything*. Some collections of points are so scrambled, so paradoxically arranged, that the very concept of ‘size’ breaks down when you try to apply it to them.”

“This is giving me a headache,” announced Émile.

“Me too,” agreed Margot. “But it’s an *interesting* headache.”

The Dust settled into a more comfortable configuration. “Think of it this way: in your world, you have a list of Things You Can Measure. That list includes your garden path, and the lawn, and the apple tree. It includes everything made by combining those things—if you can measure the path and the lawn separately, you can measure them together. If you can measure something, you can measure what’s left over when you take it away.”

“That sounds reasonable,” said Émile cautiously.

“It is! It’s a *lovely* system. Mathematicians call that list a sigma-algebra, but really it’s just the collection of all the questions about your garden that you can actually *answer*. Like: Is this point on the path? Is this area more than 5 square meters?”

“So what are you?” asked Margot.

“I,” said the Dust proudly, “am made of points from your garden that have been chosen in such a clever, twisted way that I’m not on the list. I’m like a question that sounds like it should make sense, but actually doesn’t. I’m a grammatically correct sentence that means nothing at all.”

Émile sat down on the grass, his notebook forgotten. “But you *exist*. You’re right there.”

“Am I?” The Dust seemed amused. “Can you describe exactly which points of the garden belong to me? Can you draw a map that shows where I am? Can you perform any experiment whatsoever that would let you determine my size?”

There was a long silence.

“No,” Émile finally admitted. “I can’t.”

“Then perhaps,” suggested the Dust gently, “I exist in mathematics, but not in the kind of reality where measuring tapes work. I’m possible in theory but impossible in practice. I’m the ghost of a garden set.”

## Chapter Three: The Infinite Dust That Takes No Space

“If you think I’m strange,” said the Dust, clearly enjoying itself now, “you should meet my cousin.”

“You have a cousin?” Margot perked up.

“Oh yes. She lives in that old box of buttons your mother keeps on the shelf. Well, not *in* it exactly. She’s arranged along the edge of the shelf in a very particular pattern. Shall I call her?”

Before either child could respond, something began to materialize along the garden wall. It looked like dust again, but different—this dust was precise, almost crystalline, formed of infinite tiny gaps and infinitely many points arranged in a pattern that seemed to repeat and repeat and repeat, getting smaller and smaller forever.

“I’m a Cantor Set,” announced the new arrival without preamble. “And I am the most paradoxical thing you will meet today, which is saying something considering my cousin over there.”

“Paradoxical how?” asked Émile, who had reopened his notebook.

“I,” said the Cantor Set, “am made of infinitely many points. Uncountably infinite, in fact—there are as many points in me as there are in your entire garden. And yet, I take up no space at all.”

“That’s impossible,” said Émile flatly.

“And yet, here I am. Let me show you how I’m made.” The Cantor Set seemed to shimmer, and suddenly the children could see its structure.

“Start with this piece of the wall—say, one meter long. Now remove the middle third, but keep the ends. You’re left with two pieces, each one-third of a meter. Now remove the middle third of *each* of those pieces, keeping the ends. You have four pieces, each one-ninth of a meter. Keep going forever: remove the middle third, keep the ends, remove the middle third, keep the ends…”

“Forever?” asked Margot.

“Forever,” confirmed the Cantor Set. “And what’s left, after you’ve removed all those middle thirds—that’s me.”

Émile was calculating furiously. “But if you remove one-third, then two-ninths, then four-twenty-sevenths… that’s a geometric series… it adds up to the whole meter! You’ve removed *everything*!”

“Not quite,” said the Cantor Set smugly. “I kept all the endpoints. And there are infinitely many of them. In fact, there are so many endpoints that there are as many of me as there are points in the original meter.”

“But you just said all the length was removed!”

“Exactly! I have infinitely many points, but zero length. I am everywhere and nowhere. I am dust with infinite grains that weighs nothing at all. I am the mathematical equivalent of a magic trick.”

Margot laughed delightedly. “You’re impossible!”

“No,” corrected the Cantor Set. “I’m perfectly possible. In fact, I’m much *better* behaved than my cousin. I’m measurable—my measure is just zero. I’m on the list of Things You Can Measure. It’s just that the answer to ‘how big are you?’ is ‘zero,’ which confuses people.”

“Wait,” said Émile slowly. “So you can have infinitely many points but take up no space?”

“Indeed.”

“And you,” he turned to the Vitali Dust, “somehow can’t be measured at all?”

“Correct.”

“So there’s a difference between being *on the list* with the answer ‘zero’ and not being on the list at all?”

“Now you’re getting it!” both Sets said in unison.

## Chapter Four: The Incompleteness of Lists

“Here’s another puzzle for you,” said the Cantor Set, warming to its subject. “Remember how I take up zero space?”

The children nodded.

“Well, I’m made of infinitely many points. That means I’m full of tiny subsets—little collections of points inside me. Some of those little collections are *also* on your List of Measurable Things. But some of them…” The Cantor Set paused dramatically. “…are not.”

“Wait,” said Émile. “You’re saying there are subsets inside you—inside something that takes up *zero space*—that somehow aren’t measurable?”

“Exactly! Your measuring system has a hole in it. If something has zero size, it seems reasonable that everything inside it should also be measurable and also have zero size, right? But your list doesn’t work that way. It’s *incomplete*.”

“That seems like a flaw,” observed Margot.

“It is!” agreed the Cantor Set. “That’s why mathematicians patch it. They extend the list by adding a rule: if something has zero size, then *everything* inside it automatically gets added to the list and also has zero size. That patched list is called the *complete* measure system.”

“So you take a list that has holes,” said Émile slowly, “and you fill in the holes with all the tiny unmeasurable things hiding inside the zero-size things?”

“Precisely! It’s like saying: if we’ve already declared that a dust mote weighs nothing, we shouldn’t get confused about whether half a dust mote can be weighed. The answer is obvious—it also weighs nothing.”

The Vitali Dust, which had been quiet, suddenly swirled. “But you can’t patch me into the list. I’m not hiding inside something measurable. I’m fundamentally, irreducibly outside the system.”

## Chapter Five: The Map That Cannot Be Drawn

“I still don’t understand,” said Margot, “why any of this matters. So some things can be measured and some things can’t. So what?”

The Vitali Dust and the Cantor Set exchanged glances (insofar as mathematical sets can exchange glances).

“Let me pose you a problem,” said the Vitali Dust. “Suppose you’re building a robot to water the garden. The robot needs instructions: for each spot in the garden, should it water or not water?”

“That’s easy,” said Émile. “We make a rule: water the parts that are lawn, don’t water the parts that are path.”

“Good! Your rule is: *if the spot is in the set called ‘lawn,’ water it*. Now, here’s the question: what’s the *probability* that, if the robot picks a random spot in the garden, it will water that spot?”

“Well, that’s just the fraction of the garden that’s lawn,” said Émile. “If the lawn is, say, 34 square meters and the whole garden is 50 square meters, then it’s 34/50.”

“Correct. Now, suppose instead your rule is: *if the spot is in me, water it*. What’s the probability now?”

Émile opened his mouth. Then closed it. Then opened it again.

“I… I can’t calculate it. Because I can’t measure you.”

“Exactly!” The Vitali Dust spun excitedly. “A robot following my instructions would be asked to do something *physically impossible*. The question ‘should I water this spot?’ requires the robot to determine if the spot belongs to me. But to determine that, it would need infinite information about the exact location of the point, arranged in such a twisted way that no measurement, no sensor, no observation of any kind could ever answer it.”

“So,” said Margot slowly, “when mathematicians say a function has to be ‘measurable,’ they don’t mean it to be annoying. They mean it has to be something a robot could actually *do*?”

“Or a person could do, or a computer could do, or anything physical could do,” confirmed the Cantor Set. “A measurable function is one whose instructions only require answering questions that are on the List of Things You Can Measure. An unmeasurable function is one whose instructions require impossible information.”

“It’s the difference,” added the Vitali Dust, “between a map that could theoretically be drawn, even if it’s very complicated, and a map that is logically impossible to draw because it requires knowing the answer to unanswerable questions.”

Émile was quiet for a long moment, his notebook open to a blank page.

“So mathematics,” he said finally, “isn’t just about what we can imagine. It’s about what we can actually *do*?”

“Some mathematics is about what you can imagine,” corrected the Cantor Set. “I can imagine all sorts of impossible things, and that’s part of the fun. But the mathematics of *building things*, of *controlling things*, of *making decisions* in the real world—that mathematics has to stay tethered to reality. It has to respect the boundary between the answerable and the unanswerable.”

## Chapter Six: The Lesson of the Garden

As the sun began to set, the two strange Sets prepared to depart.

“Will you come back?” asked Margot.

“We’re always here,” said the Cantor Set. “I live in every pattern that repeats forever, in every infinite fractal boundary, in every dust that has infinite pieces but no weight.”

“And I,” said the Vitali Dust, “live in every impossible question, in every instruction that sounds reasonable but isn’t, in every gap between what we can write down and what we can actually do.”

“One more thing,” said Émile suddenly. “Why does the garden path keep changing its number of stones?”

The Sets laughed—a sound like wind through equations.

“Perhaps,” said the Vitali Dust, “you’re not measuring the stones themselves, but something else. Something that changes depending on how you count, when you count, which stones you decide are ‘on’ the path versus ‘near’ the path…”

“Or perhaps,” suggested the Cantor Set, “your path is fractal at the edges, with infinitely many tiny pebbles that may or may not count as ‘stones,’ and the answer depends on how closely you look…”

“Or perhaps,” said Margot with a grin, “the garden really does rearrange itself when we’re not looking, and we should just accept that some things are mysterious.”

Émile closed his notebook. “That,” he said, “is unscientific.”

“But,” he added after a pause, “possibly true anyway.”

## What Émile and Margot Learned (And You Can Too)

That night, as Margot was falling asleep, she thought about the List of Measurable Things. She realized that the list wasn’t about what was *real*—the Vitali Dust was, in some sense, as real as anything else. The list was about what was *observable*, what could be answered by looking and measuring and experimenting.

And Émile, lying in his own bed with his notebook on the nightstand, understood something new. Mathematics wasn’t just about being right. It was about being right *in a way that connected to the world*. You could write down perfect, beautiful equations about impossible things, but if you wanted to build a robot, or make a decision, or give instructions that could actually be followed… then your mathematics had to stay on the List.

Not everything that exists can be measured.
But everything that can be built must be measurable.

And that, they both realized, was the most important thing they’d learned all day.

**A Note for Curious Minds:**

The strange Sets in this story are real mathematical objects. The Cantor Set truly does have infinitely many points but zero length—you can construct it yourself by taking a line, removing the middle third, then removing the middle third of what remains, and so on forever. The Vitali Set truly is impossible to measure using any consistent measuring system.

When mathematicians talk about σ-algebras and measurable functions, they’re talking about exactly what Émile and Margot discovered: the difference between what we can write down and what we can actually do. In reinforcement learning, in robotics, in any mathematics that touches the real world, we need our functions—our policies, our value estimates, our control laws—to be measurable. Not because unmeasurable functions don’t exist, but because unmeasurable functions require impossible information to implement.

The world is full of wonder, but some wonders live only in imagination, while others can be built with our hands.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
