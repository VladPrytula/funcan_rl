# Project 8.5: Connect Four with Monte Carlo Tree Search

**Status**: Complete (Environment + MCTS + Terminal + Web Interface)
**Implementation Date**: October 2025 (Week 2, 29 weeks ahead of Syllabus Week 31)
**Documentation**: [Quick Start](QUICKSTART.md) • [Tutorial](TUTORIAL.md) • [Advanced Topics](ADVANCED.md)

## Overview

This project implements Connect Four AI using **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with UCT** (Upper Confidence bounds for Trees), demonstrating the connection between bandit theory (Weeks 27-28) and game tree search.

**Key Innovation**: Real-time visualization of MCTS search statistics exposes the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in action.

## 🎯 Theory Connections

### 1. Connect Four as Finite MDP ([THM-24.X.Y])

**MDP Formulation:**
- **State space S**: Game positions (4.5 trillion reachable states)
- **Action space A(s)**: Columns with empty top cell (max 7)
- **Transition P**: Deterministic (piece drops via gravity)
- **Reward R**: +1 (win), -1 (loss), 0 (draw)
- **Discount γ**: 1 (episodic, no discounting)

**Bellman Optimality**: V*(s) = max_a [R(s,a) + γ Σ P(s'|s,a) V*(s')]

**Complexity**: 4.5 trillion states → exact search intractable → MCTS approximates V* via sampling

**References**:
- Allis (1988): Connect Four is solved (first player wins with perfect play)
- Our approach: MCTS approximates V* via Monte Carlo sampling

### 2. MCTS as UCB1 on Game Trees ([THM-28.X.Y])

**Key Insight**: Each MCTS node is a multi-armed bandit problem.

**UCT Formula (Upper Confidence bounds for Trees)**:
```
UCT(s,a) = Q(s,a) + c√(ln N(s) / N(s,a))
           ↑           ↑
     Exploitation  Exploration
```

Where:
- `Q(s,a) = W(s,a) / N(s,a)`: Average value from action a
- `c = √2 ≈ 1.41`: Exploration constant (theoretically optimal)
- `N(s)`: Parent visit count
- `N(s,a)`: Child visit count

**Theory ([THM-28.X.Y])**:
- **UCB1 regret bound**: O(√(K log n / n)) per node (K arms, n trials)
- **MCTS convergence**: UCT converges to minimax in the limit
- **Asymmetric growth**: Tree expands toward promising moves

**Practice**:
- **Move selection**: argmax N(s,a) (most visited), not argmax Q(s,a)
- **Why**: Visit count more robust to outlier simulations

---

### 3. Heuristic Evaluation as Approximate Value Function

**Theory ([THM-24.X.Y])**: V*(s) = exact Bellman backup (requires full game tree)

**Practice**: h(s) ≈ V*(s) via domain knowledge (pattern recognition)

**Our Heuristic Algorithm**:
1. Open 3-in-a-row: +100 (immediate threat)
2. Open 2-in-a-row: +10 (potential)
3. Opponent threats: -100 (defensive)
4. Center column control: +3 per piece (positional bonus)
5. Normalize to [-1, 1]

**Theory-Practice Gap (Honest Assessment)**:
- ✅ **Theory guarantees**: V* is unique optimal value function
- ⚠️ **Practice reality**: h(s) is "good enough," not optimal
- ✅ **Why it works**: Guides MCTS toward promising regions
- ❌ **When it fails**: Tactical positions (h misses forced wins/losses)

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### MCTS Parameters

**`--num-simulations` (default: 1000)**
- More simulations → stronger play, slower
- 100: Weak (for testing)
- 1000: Strong (default)
- 1600: Very strong (competitive)

**`--exploration-constant` (default: 1.41 = √2)**
- Higher c → more exploration
- Lower c → more exploitation
- Theory: c = √2 optimal for bounded rewards

**`--max-depth` (default: None)**
- Limit simulation depth, use heuristic at cutoff
- None: Simulate to game end (exact)
- 10-20: Faster, uses heuristic

**Board Size**: Default 6×7 (standard Connect Four), configurable via `--board-size rows×cols`

---

- Gravity mechanics (5 tests)
- Win detection (5 tests: horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- Game flow (4 tests: alternating turns, draw, reset, copy)
- Heuristic evaluation (5 tests: symmetry, terminal correctness, boundedness)
- Edge cases (5 tests: rectangular boards, full columns)

**MCTS Algorithm Tests** (`test_mcts.py` - 20 tests):
- UCT score computation (3 tests)
- Tree building (4 tests: selection, expansion, simulation, backpropagation)
- Convergence (3 tests: more simulations improve play, finds forced wins)
- Integration (4 tests: MCTS beats random 70%+, statistics tracking)
- Depth-limited search (3 tests: heuristic cutoff)
- Edge cases (3 tests: terminal states, single move)

**Web API Tests** (`test_api.py` - 16 tests):

**Total: 65 tests, all passing**

### Validation Results

**MCTS vs Random Play**: 70-90% win rate (10 games, 200 simulations per move)

**Search Statistics (1000 simulations)**:
- Nodes explored: 1000-1500 (tree grows asymmetrically)
- Max tree depth: 10-20 (depends on position)
- Time per move: ~0.5-1 second (Python, no optimization)

## 📊 MCTS Visualization

When you run with `--show-search-tree`, you see:

```
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MCTS Search Tree Statistics
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Theory: UCT formula guides selection during tree search
  UCT(s,a) = Q(s,a) + c√(ln N(s) / N(s,a))
  Best move = argmax N(s,a) (most visited, not highest Q)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Column   Visits   Q-value    UCT        Assessment                          Best
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
a        347      +0.680        0.520   heavily explored, strong position    ⭐
b        128      +0.540        0.760   moderately explored, strong position
c        289      +0.620        0.580   heavily explored, strong position
d        94       +0.410        0.820   moderately explored, balanced
e        71       +0.280        0.910   lightly explored, balanced
f        42       +0.310        0.890   lightly explored, weak position
g        29       +0.150        1.020   lightly explored, weak position
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

**What you're seeing**:
- **Visits**: N(s,a) - how many times MCTS explored this column
- **Q-value**: Average game outcome from this move (exploitation)
- **UCT**: UCT(s,a) score during search (exploration + exploitation)
- **Assessment**: Natural language interpretation
- **Best**: Most visited move (argmax N(s,a)) marked with ⭐

**Theory in Action**:
- Column `a` is best (most visited), despite other columns having higher Q-values
- Why? More visits = more confidence in the estimate
- Lightly explored moves (f, g) have high UCT → will be explored more if promising
