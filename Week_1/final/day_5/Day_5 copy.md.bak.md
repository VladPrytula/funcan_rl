[[Day_4#]]

### Agenda:

##### 📘 Day 5 – Week 1 (Friday Synthesis): Measurability, Observability, and Computational Verification
**Total time: ~90 minutes (Friday synthesis session)**

---

#### **⏱️ Segment 1 (20 min) – Reading & Review**

**Topic:** _Synthesis of Week 1: From Abstract Measure Theory to Concrete RL Applications_

- **Quick Review of the Week:**
  - **Day 1:** σ-algebras and measurable functions (the language of observability)
  - **Day 2:** Measures and integration (assigning probabilities and computing expectations)
  - **Day 3:** Fatou and Dominated Convergence (limit interchange machinery)
  - **Day 4:** Carathéodory Extension (constructing Lebesgue measure rigorously)

- **Key Takeaway:** The σ-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ on a state space $\mathcal{S}$ defines precisely which events are observable. A policy $\pi: \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{A}$ must be $\mathcal{F}$-measurable to be physically realizable. The Carathéodory construction ensures that transition kernels $P(\cdot | s,a)$ are well-defined probability measures on $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{F})$.

---

#### **⏱️ Segment 2 (30 min) – Proof Review**

**Exercise:**
Review the two anchor exercises from this week:
1. **π-λ Theorem** (Day 1 anchor exercise 1): Verify you understand how π-systems and λ-systems interact to generate σ-algebras
2. **Borel σ-algebra generation** (Day 1 anchor exercise 2): Confirm that $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ can be generated by open balls, half-open rectangles, or open sets

**Reflection Question:**
How does the π-λ theorem simplify proofs involving σ-algebras? (Answer: Instead of checking closure under countable unions directly, we can work with simpler generating sets.)

## **Chapter 1: Foundations in Measure and Probability Theory**

### **1.6 Synthesis: Measurability as Observability in Reinforcement Learning**

**Motivation:** We have spent four days constructing the abstract edifice of measure theory: σ-algebras, measures, measurable functions, convergence theorems, and the Carathéodory extension. To the pragmatic reader engaged with reinforcement learning algorithms—deep Q-networks, policy gradients, actor-critic methods—this may seem like a detour into mathematical formalism. It is not.

Every object in RL theory depends fundamentally on this structure. The state space $\mathcal{S}$ is not merely a set but a **measurable space** $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{S}})$. The transition kernel $P(\cdot | s,a)$ is not merely a function but a **probability measure** on this space. A policy $\pi$ is not merely a mapping but a **measurable function** compatible with the σ-algebra. Without these foundations, the Bellman equations are undefined, value iteration has no convergence guarantees, and temporal difference learning is mathematically incoherent.

This final day of Week 1 synthesizes the theoretical machinery we have built and makes explicit its operational meaning in RL. We will implement computational tools to visualize σ-algebra generation and set operations, building concrete intuition for these abstract concepts. Most importantly, we will articulate the central thesis of this week:

> **The σ-algebra encodes observability. Measurability is the mathematical expression of physical realizability.**

**Learning Objectives:**
* Synthesize the week's material into a coherent framework connecting measure theory to RL
* Implement a discrete σ-algebra generator to visualize set operations computationally
* Understand the hierarchy: semiring → algebra → σ-algebra as levels of observational closure
* Reflect on the correspondence between measurability and information-theoretic constraints

### **I. Review: The Four Pillars of Week 1**

Before we proceed to computational synthesis, let us consolidate the week's central results.

#### **Pillar 1: σ-Algebras Define Observability**

**Definition Recap (1.1):** A σ-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ on a set $X$ is a collection of subsets closed under:
1. Complementation: $A \in \mathcal{F} \Rightarrow A^c \in \mathcal{F}$
2. Countable unions: $A_1, A_2, \ldots \in \mathcal{F} \Rightarrow \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \in \mathcal{F}$

**RL Interpretation:** The σ-algebra $\mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{S}}$ on a state space $\mathcal{S}$ defines the collection of events to which we can assign probabilities. A set $A \subseteq \mathcal{S}$ is **observable** if and only if $A \in \mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{S}}$.

**Example:** For $\mathcal{S} = \mathbb{R}^n$ (continuous control), we use the Borel σ-algebra $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, which is generated by open sets. An agent can measure whether the state $s$ belongs to an open region (e.g., "position $> 0$"), and through countable operations, can observe all Borel sets. But non-Borel sets (like Vitali sets) are **not observable**—they require uncountably infinite information.

#### **Pillar 2: Measurable Functions Preserve Structure**

**Definition Recap (1.8):** A function $f: (X, \mathcal{F}) \to (Y, \mathcal{G})$ is measurable if for every $B \in \mathcal{G}$, the preimage $f^{-1}(B) \in \mathcal{F}$.

**RL Interpretation:**
- A **policy** $\pi: \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{A}$ must be measurable. This ensures that the decision "which action to take" depends only on observable information about the state.
- A **value function** $V: \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}$ must be measurable to compute expectations $\mathbb{E}[V(S')]$ with respect to the transition kernel.
- Neural network function approximators $V_\theta: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ are compositions of continuous functions (affine maps + activations), hence Borel-measurable by Proposition 1.4.

**Closure Properties (Week 1, Propositions 1.3-1.4):** Measurable functions are closed under:
- Arithmetic operations: $f + g$, $f \cdot g$, $\max(f,g)$
- Composition with continuous functions: $h \circ f$ if $h$ continuous
- Pointwise limits (when dominated): $\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n$ is measurable if each $f_n$ is measurable

This robustness ensures that Bellman operators $TV$, policy improvement steps, and gradient updates all preserve measurability.

#### **Pillar 3: Dominated Convergence Enables Limit Interchange**

**Theorem Recap (1.8, DCT):** If $f_n \to f$ pointwise and $|f_n| \leq g$ for integrable $g$, then:
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \int f_n \, d\mu = \int f \, d\mu
$$

**RL Interpretation:** Nearly every convergence proof in RL—value iteration, policy iteration, TD learning, Q-learning, policy gradients—relies on DCT to justify:
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{E}_\mu[V_n] = \mathbb{E}_\mu\left[\lim_{n \to \infty} V_n\right]
$$

The dominating function $g$ corresponds to **boundedness assumptions**:
- Bounded rewards: $|R(s,a)| \leq R_{\max}$
- Bounded value functions: $|V(s)| \leq V_{\max} = R_{\max}/(1-\gamma)$ (when $\gamma < 1$)
- Bounded gradients: $\|\nabla_\theta V_\theta(s)\| \leq C$ (Lipschitz neural networks)

Without these bounds, DCT fails, and convergence is not guaranteed.

#### **Pillar 4: Carathéodory Extension Constructs Measures Rigorously**

**Theorem Recap (1.9-1.10):** Given a pre-measure $\mu_0$ on an algebra $\mathcal{A}$:
1. Extend to an outer measure $\mu^*$ via infimum over covers
2. Identify Carathéodory-measurable sets via the criterion $\mu^*(T) = \mu^*(T \cap E) + \mu^*(T \cap E^c)$
3. Restrict $\mu^*$ to the σ-algebra $\mathcal{M}$ of measurable sets to obtain a true measure $\mu$

**RL Interpretation:** The transition kernel $P(\cdot | s,a)$ in continuous-state MDPs is constructed via Carathéodory:
- Start with probabilities on simple sets (rectangles): $P(R | s,a) = \int_R p(s' | s,a) \, ds'$
- Extend to all Borel sets via outer measure
- Carathéodory's theorem guarantees $P(\cdot | s,a)$ is a probability measure on $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{S}))$

This rigorous construction ensures that expectations $\mathbb{E}_{s' \sim P(\cdot|s,a)}[V(s')]$ are well-defined.

---

### **II. Computational Illustration: Discrete σ-Algebra Generator**

To build intuition, we implement a **discrete σ-algebra generator** for finite sets. Given a generating collection $\mathcal{G}$, we construct $\sigma(\mathcal{G})$ explicitly.

**Algorithm:** For a finite set $X = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$:
1. Start with $\mathcal{F}_0 = \mathcal{G} \cup \{\emptyset, X\}$
2. Iteratively close under complement and finite union until no new sets are added
3. For finite $X$, this terminates (since $|2^X| = 2^n < \infty$)

**Python Implementation:**

```python
import itertools
from typing import Set, FrozenSet

def sigma_algebra_generator(X: Set[int], generators: Set[FrozenSet[int]]) -> Set[FrozenSet[int]]:
    """
    Generate the smallest σ-algebra containing the generators.

    Parameters:

    generators : Set[FrozenSet[int]]
        Collection of generating sets (each is a frozenset)

    Returns:
    --------
    Set[FrozenSet[int]]

    """
    X_frozen = frozenset(X)
    sigma = {frozenset(), X_frozen}  # Start with ∅ and X
    sigma.update(generators)

    changed = True
    iterations = 0
    max_iterations = 1000  # Safety check for infinite loops

    while changed and iterations < max_iterations:
        iterations += 1
        new_sets = set()

        # Close under complement
        for A in sigma:
            complement = X_frozen - A
            if complement not in sigma:
                new_sets.add(complement)

        # Close under finite union (for finite X, this suffices for countable union)
        # We take unions of all pairs (sufficient for closure)
        for A, B in itertools.combinations(sigma, 2):
            union = A | B
            if union not in sigma:
                new_sets.add(union)

        if new_sets:
            sigma.update(new_sets)
        else:
            changed = False

    return sigma

        else:

```

**Remark (Algorithm Termination).** The `sigma_algebra_generator` algorithm is guaranteed to terminate for finite ground sets $X$. The σ-algebra $\sigma(\mathcal{G})$ is a subset of the power set $2^X$, which has $2^{|X|}$ elements. Each iteration either adds at least one new set to `sigma` or terminates (when `new_sets` is empty). Therefore, the number of iterations is bounded by $2^{|X|}$. For the examples above ($|X| \leq 6$), this bound is $2^6 = 64$ iterations, though in practice the algorithm terminates much faster due to the rapid closure under complements and unions.

For **infinite** ground sets $X$ (such as $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{N}$), this algorithm cannot be implemented directly—the σ-algebra $\sigma(\mathcal{G})$ is typically uncountable (e.g., $|\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})| = 2^{\aleph_0}$, the cardinality of the continuum). In such cases, we work with the σ-algebra **implicitly** through its generating sets (e.g., defining $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$ as $\sigma(\text{open sets})$ without enumerating all Borel sets).

**Expected Output Highlights:**

```
============================================================
EXAMPLE 2: σ-algebra generated by A = {1}
============================================================
Ground set X = [1, 2, 3]
σ-algebra has 4 sets:

   1. ∅
   2. [1]
   3. [2, 3]
   4. X = [1, 2, 3]

→ This is {∅, {1}, {2,3}, X}
→ Closure adds the complement {2,3} = A^c
```

```
============================================================
EXAMPLE 4: State space partitioned by 'good' vs 'bad' states
============================================================
Ground set X = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
σ-algebra has 4 sets:

   1. ∅
   2. [1, 2, 3]
   3. [4, 5, 6]
   4. X = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

→ In RL: If we can only observe whether state is 'good' or 'bad',
   the σ-algebra has only 4 sets: ∅, good, bad, X
→ A policy based on this σ-algebra treats all good states identically
```

**Interpretation:**

1. **Example 2** shows that the σ-algebra generated by a single set $A$ is $\{\emptyset, A, A^c, X\}$—the smallest σ-algebra containing $A$. This is the **minimal observable structure** when we can only distinguish "$s \in A$" vs. "$s \notin A$".

2. **Example 4** (RL-inspired) demonstrates **coarse observability**. If an agent can only measure whether the state is "good" or "bad", it cannot implement policies that distinguish individual good states. The σ-algebra $\mathcal{F} = \{\emptyset, \text{good}, \text{bad}, X\}$ constrains the policy class.

3. **Example 5** shows that **finer observations** (ability to distinguish region A from region B) enlarge the σ-algebra, enabling more refined policies. This is the mathematical formalization of "partial observability" in POMDPs.

### **III. Visualization: Set Operations and Carathéodory Measurability**

We now visualize the **Carathéodory measurability criterion** for a specific set.

**Definition 1.17 (Carathéodory Measurability Criterion).** Let $\mu^*$ be an outer measure on a set $X$. A set $E \subseteq X$ is called **$\mu^*$-measurable** (or simply measurable with respect to $\mu^*$) if for every test set $A \subseteq X$:
$$
\mu^*(A) = \mu^*(A \cap E) + \mu^*(A \cap E^c)
$$

**Geometric Interpretation:** $E$ "splits" every set $A$ additively. The outer measure of $A$ equals the sum of the outer measures of the parts inside and outside $E$.

**Visualization Code:**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.patches as mpatches

    """

```

**Output:**
- Three panels showing $E$, $A \cap E$, and $A \cap E^c$
- Numerical verification that $\lambda(A) = \lambda(A \cap E) + \lambda(A \cap E^c)$

**Interpretation:** The Carathéodory criterion is a **geometric additivity test**. A set $E$ is measurable if it decomposes every test set $A$ into two pieces ($A \cap E$ and $A \cap E^c$) whose measures add up to the measure of $A$. For rectangles (and all Borel sets), this holds by construction. For pathological sets (like Vitali sets), this fails—there is no consistent way to assign a measure.

### **IV. Application Bridge: σ-Algebras and Partial Observability in RL**

**Connection 1: Finite-State MDPs with Information Constraints**

Consider a gridworld with 16 states arranged in a 4×4 grid. The agent can observe its exact position, so the σ-algebra is $\mathcal{F} = 2^{\mathcal{S}}$ (the power set—all subsets are observable).

Now suppose the agent has only a **coarse sensor** that reports which quadrant the agent is in (NW, NE, SW, SE). The σ-algebra is now:
$$
\mathcal{F}_{\text{coarse}} = \sigma(\{NW, NE, SW, SE\})
$$
This has only $2^4 = 16$ sets (compared to $2^{16} = 65536$ for full observability).

**Consequence:** A policy $\pi$ measurable with respect to $\mathcal{F}_{\text{coarse}}$ must assign the same action to all states in the same quadrant. This is the mathematical formalization of **partial observability**—the agent cannot implement policies that require finer distinctions.

**Connection 2: Continuous State Spaces and the Borel σ-Algebra**

For $\mathcal{S} = \mathbb{R}^n$ (e.g., joint angles of a robot arm), the Borel σ-algebra $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is generated by open sets. An agent can measure:
- Whether $s \in (a, b)$ (open interval)
- Whether $s \in \mathbb{R}^n \setminus K$ for closed $K$ (complement of closed set)
- Countable unions/intersections of such sets

But the agent **cannot** measure membership in non-Borel sets. This is not a practical limitation—physical sensors perform finite-precision measurements (e.g., "position within $[a - \epsilon, a + \epsilon]$"), which correspond to **closed intervals** and their countable unions/intersections. All such sets are Borel-measurable.

**Connection 3: POMDPs and Information Sets**

In a Partially Observable MDP (POMDP), the agent does not observe the true state $s \in \mathcal{S}$ but rather an observation $o \in \mathcal{O}$. The observation function $h: \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{O}$ induces a σ-algebra on $\mathcal{S}$:
$$
\mathcal{F}_{\text{observable}} = \{h^{-1}(B) : B \subseteq \mathcal{O}\}
$$
A policy can depend only on the **belief state** $b(s) = \mathbb{P}(s | \text{history})$, which is $\mathcal{F}_{\text{observable}}$-measurable.

**Summary:** The σ-algebra structure is not an abstraction—it is the **information-theoretic constraint** on what policies can be implemented. Measurability is the requirement that decisions can be made based on observable information.

### **V. Reflection and Forward Connections**

**What We Have Achieved (Week 1):**

1. **Constructed the language of measurable spaces:** σ-algebras $\mathcal{F}$ define observable events, measures $\mu$ assign sizes/probabilities, measurable functions preserve structure.

2. **Established convergence machinery:** MCT, Fatou, DCT enable interchange of limits and expectations—the foundation of all iterative algorithms in RL.

3. **Proved rigor is not optional:** The Carathéodory extension shows that transition kernels on continuous spaces require this machinery. Non-measurable policies are mathematical fictions, not implementable in any physical system.

4. **Built computational intuition:** Discrete σ-algebra generators and Carathéodory visualizations make abstract concepts concrete.

### **Postponed Generalizations Log (Week 1)**

Throughout this week, we have occasionally proven results in simplified settings to respect time constraints while maintaining pedagogical clarity. The following table documents what was postponed, why, and when these generalizations become essential for RL applications.

| **What Was Postponed** | **Why Postponed** | **Where Proven** | **When It Matters for RL** |
|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Carathéodory Extension for general metric spaces | Initial treatment focused on $\mathbb{R}^n$ for concreteness | Day 4, Theorem 1.10 (proven for $\mathbb{R}^n$) | **Week 12**: General state-space MDPs (Polish spaces, Meyn-Tweedie) |
| π-λ Theorem: Full generality (arbitrary set systems) | Proved for algebras generated by π-systems; general case deferred | Day 1 exercises, Exercise 1 | **Week 6**: Conditional expectation on general filtrations |
| Radon-Nikodym Theorem for general σ-finite measures | Week 1 focused on Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ | Not yet covered | **Week 28**: Absolutely continuous policies in continuous action spaces |
| Convergence theorems for nets (beyond sequences) | Sequential convergence sufficient for $\mathbb{R}^n$ | Day 3, Theorems 1.6-1.8 | **Week 40**: Weak* convergence in measure-valued MDPs (mean-field games) |

**Important Notes:**

1. **Carathéodory on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is production-grade** for nearly all deep RL applications (Atari, robotics, continuous control). The general metric space version becomes necessary only for exotic state spaces (function-valued states, infinite-dimensional control).

2. **π-λ Theorem as stated** (Day 1, Exercise 1) is sufficient for all finite and countable state spaces, and for Borel σ-algebras on $\mathbb{R}^n$. The full generality is a measure-theoretic nicety rather than a practical necessity.

3. **Radon-Nikodym postponement** does not limit our ability to work with absolutely continuous measures in Weeks 2-24. We will encounter it naturally when studying policy parameterizations in continuous action spaces.

4. **Sequential convergence** is universal in computational RL (iterative algorithms, neural network training). Net-based convergence appears only in theoretical RL (convergence of empirical measures in the weak* topology).

This log will be updated weekly to maintain transparency about proof scope and mathematical rigor.

---

**Open Questions for Week 2:**

1. **Convergence in $L^p$ vs. pointwise:** When does $\int |f_n - f|^p \to 0$ imply $f_n \to f$ almost everywhere? (Answer: For subsequences, by Riesz-Fischer.)

2. **Completeness of $L^p$ spaces:** Why is completeness essential for defining value function spaces? (Answer: Fixed-point theorems require complete metric spaces.)

3. **Fubini's theorem:** When can we interchange the order of integration in double integrals? (Essential for computing expectations over product spaces, e.g., $\mathbb{E}_{s,s'}[\cdots]$.)

**Looking Ahead:**

- **Week 2:** $L^p$ spaces, Hölder/Minkowski inequalities, Riesz representation theorem. We will see that value functions naturally live in $L^\infty(\mathcal{S})$ (bounded functions with supremum norm).

- **Week 6:** Conditional expectation $\mathbb{E}[R | \mathcal{F}]$ as orthogonal projection in $L^2$. The tower property becomes the Bellman consistency equation.

- **Week 12:** Transition kernels on general state spaces (Meyn-Tweedie). Carathéodory's construction generalizes to product measures $\mu \times P(\cdot | s,a)$.

- **Week 25:** MDP formalism synthesizes everything: $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{F}, \mathcal{A}, P, R, \gamma)$ with measurability requirements throughout.

**The Central Thesis of Week 1:**

> Measure theory is not a prerequisite to RL—it **is** the mathematical language of RL. Without σ-algebras, we cannot define transition kernels. Without measurable functions, we cannot define policies. Without DCT, we cannot prove convergence of value iteration. Every algorithm, every theorem, every proof in RL theory rests on this foundation.

When we write $V^* = \max_\pi V^\pi$ or $\nabla J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}[\nabla \log \pi_\theta \cdot G]$, we are making statements that are rigorously meaningful only because of the measure-theoretic structure we have constructed this week.

This is not formalism for its own sake. It is the difference between mathematics and mythology.

## **Weekly Reflection (Week 1)**

### **Mathematical Insight**

This week established the foundational architecture of measure theory: **σ-algebras** provide the structure to rigorously define "events," **measures** quantify their size, and the **Monotone/Dominated Convergence Theorems** enable controlled interchange of limits and integrals. The **Carathéodory Extension Theorem** (proven here for $\mathbb{R}^n$) shows that specifying measures on simple sets (rectangles) uniquely determines measures on all Borel sets—a construction principle we will exploit throughout probability theory.

The key conceptual breakthrough is recognizing that the σ-algebra is not merely a mathematical artifact but the **formalization of observability**. A set $A \subseteq \mathcal{S}$ is in the σ-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ if and only if an agent can, in principle, determine whether the current state belongs to $A$ through finite or countably infinite observations. Measurable functions are precisely those whose computation can be performed using only observable information.

### **RL Connection**

In RL, state and action spaces must be **measurable spaces** to define transition kernels $P(\cdot|s,a)$ and compute expectations $\mathbb{E}[R|s,a]$. The σ-algebra structure determines which sets of states are "observable" by the agent:
- In **discrete MDPs**, we typically use the power set $2^{\mathcal{S}}$ (full observability)
- In **continuous MDPs** ($\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$), we use the Borel σ-algebra $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{S})$
- In **POMDPs**, the σ-algebra is induced by the observation function, capturing partial observability

**Monotone Convergence** will underpin policy iteration (monotonic value function updates), while **Dominated Convergence** enables gradient interchange in policy gradient methods. The Carathéodory construction ensures that transition kernels on continuous spaces are well-defined probability measures, making the Bellman operator a rigorous mathematical object.

### **Open Questions**

1. **Infinite-Dimensional State Spaces:** How does the Carathéodory extension fail (or require modification) for infinite-dimensional state spaces, as in continuous control with function-valued states (e.g., controlling a distributed parameter system)? When do empirical measures from RL trajectories converge to true transition kernels—what regularity conditions are required?

2. **Non-σ-Finite Measures:** The uniqueness of Carathéodory's extension requires σ-finiteness. For MDPs with unbounded state spaces, is σ-finiteness always guaranteed? What happens if it fails? Can we still define meaningful value functions?

3. **Measurability of Optimal Policies:** We proved that measurable functions are closed under arithmetic and composition with continuous functions. But is the **argmax** operation measurable? That is, if $Q(s, \cdot): \mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{R}$ is measurable for each $s$, is $\pi^*(s) = \arg\max_a Q(s,a)$ a measurable function? (Hint: This requires the **Measurable Selection Theorem**, which states that if the argmax is taken over a compact set and the objective function is continuous, then a measurable selection exists. We will prove this in Week 25 when formalizing optimal policies.)

**End of Week 1 – Day 5**

📅 **Week 2 Preview:** We build the $L^p$ function spaces where value functions live, prove Hölder and Minkowski inequalities, establish the Riesz representation theorem for duality, and explore the geometry of these spaces through computational experiments. The journey from measure theory to functional analysis begins.

### Agenda:

##### 📘 Day 5 – Week 1 (Friday Synthesis): Measurability, Observability, and Computational Verification
**Total time: ~90 minutes (Friday synthesis session)**

---

#### **⏱️ Segment 1 (20 min) – Reading & Review**

**Topic:** _Synthesis of Week 1: From Abstract Measure Theory to Concrete RL Applications_

- **Quick Review of the Week:**
  - **Day 1:** $\sigma$-algebras and measurable functions (the language of observability)
  - **Day 2:** Measures and integration (assigning probabilities and computing expectations)
  - **Day 3:** Fatou and Dominated Convergence (limit interchange machinery)
  - **Day 4:** Carathéodory Extension (constructing Lebesgue measure rigorously)

- **Key Takeaway:** The $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ on a state space $\mathcal{S}$ defines precisely which events are observable. A policy $\pi: \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{A}$ must be $\mathcal{F}$-measurable to be physically realizable. The Carathéodory construction ensures that transition kernels $P(\cdot | s,a)$ are well-defined probability measures on $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{F})$.

2. **Borel $\sigma$-algebra generation** (Day 1 anchor exercise 2): Confirm that $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ can be generated by open balls, half-open rectangles, or open sets

**Reflection Question:**

## **Chapter 1: Foundations in Measure and Probability Theory**

### **1.6 Synthesis: Measurability as Observability in Reinforcement Learning**

**Motivation:** We have spent four days constructing the abstract edifice of measure theory: $\sigma$-algebras, measures, measurable functions, convergence theorems, and the Carathéodory extension. To the pragmatic reader engaged with reinforcement learning algorithms—deep Q-networks, policy gradients, actor-critic methods—this may seem like a detour into mathematical formalism. It is not.

Every object in RL theory depends fundamentally on this structure. The state space $\mathcal{S}$ is not merely a set but a **measurable space** $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{S}})$. The transition kernel $P(\cdot | s,a)$ is not merely a function but a **probability measure** on this space. A policy $\pi$ is not merely a mapping but a **measurable function** compatible with the $\sigma$-algebra. Without these foundations, the Bellman equations are undefined, value iteration has no convergence guarantees, and temporal difference learning is mathematically incoherent.

This final day of Week 1 synthesizes the theoretical machinery we have built and makes explicit its operational meaning in RL. We will implement computational tools to visualize $\sigma$-algebra generation and set operations, building concrete intuition for these abstract concepts. Most importantly, we will articulate the central thesis of this week:

> **The $\sigma$-algebra encodes observability. Measurability is the mathematical expression of physical realizability.**

**Learning Objectives:**
* Synthesize the week's material into a coherent framework connecting measure theory to RL
* Implement a discrete $\sigma$-algebra generator to visualize set operations computationally
* Understand the hierarchy: semiring $\to$ algebra $\to$ $\sigma$-algebra as levels of observational closure
* Reflect on the correspondence between measurability and information-theoretic constraints

---

### **I. Review: The Four Pillars of Week 1**

Before we proceed to computational synthesis, let us consolidate the week's central results.

#### **Pillar 1: σ-Algebras Define Observability**

**Definition Recap (1.1):** A $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ on a set $X$ is a collection of subsets closed under:
1. Complementation: $A \in \mathcal{F} \Rightarrow A^c \in \mathcal{F}$
2. Countable unions: $A_1, A_2, \ldots \in \mathcal{F} \Rightarrow \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} A_n \in \mathcal{F}$

**RL Interpretation:** The $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{S}}$ on a state space $\mathcal{S}$ defines the collection of events to which we can assign probabilities. A set $A \subseteq \mathcal{S}$ is **observable** if and only if $A \in \mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{S}}$.

**Example:** For $\mathcal{S} = \mathbb{R}^n$ (continuous control), we use the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, which is generated by open sets. An agent can measure whether the state $s$ belongs to an open region (e.g., "position $> 0$"), and through countable operations, can observe all Borel sets. But non-Borel sets (like Vitali sets) are **not observable**—they require uncountably infinite information.

#### **Pillar 2: Measurable Functions Preserve Structure**

**Definition Recap (1.8):** A function $f: (X, \mathcal{F}) \to (Y, \mathcal{G})$ is measurable if for every $B \in \mathcal{G}$, the preimage $f^{-1}(B) \in \mathcal{F}$.

**RL Interpretation:**
- A **policy** $\pi: \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{A}$ must be measurable. This ensures that the decision "which action to take" depends only on observable information about the state.
- A **value function** $V: \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}$ must be measurable to compute expectations $\mathbb{E}[V(S')]$ with respect to the transition kernel.
- Neural network function approximators $V_\theta: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ are compositions of continuous functions (affine maps + activations), hence Borel-measurable by Proposition 1.4.

**Closure Properties (Week 1, Propositions 1.3-1.4):** Measurable functions are closed under:
- Arithmetic operations: $f + g$, $f \cdot g$, $\max(f,g)$
- Composition with continuous functions: $h \circ f$ if $h$ continuous
- Pointwise limits (when dominated): $\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n$ is measurable if each $f_n$ is measurable

This robustness ensures that Bellman operators $TV$, policy improvement steps, and gradient updates all preserve measurability.

#### **Pillar 3: Dominated Convergence Enables Limit Interchange**

**Theorem Recap (1.8, DCT):** If $f_n \to f$ pointwise and $|f_n| \leq g$ for integrable $g$, then:
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \int f_n \, d\mu = \int f \, d\mu
$$

**RL Interpretation:** Nearly every convergence proof in RL—value iteration, policy iteration, TD learning, Q-learning, policy gradients—relies on DCT to justify:
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{E}_\mu[V_n] = \mathbb{E}_\mu\left[\lim_{n \to \infty} V_n\right]
$$

The dominating function $g$ corresponds to **boundedness assumptions**:
- Bounded rewards: $|R(s,a)| \leq R_{\max}$
- Bounded value functions: $|V(s)| \leq V_{\max} = R_{\max}/(1-\gamma)$ (when $\gamma < 1$)
- Bounded gradients: $\|\nabla_\theta V_\theta(s)\| \leq C$ (Lipschitz neural networks)

Without these bounds, DCT fails, and convergence is not guaranteed.

#### **Pillar 4: Carathéodory Extension Constructs Measures Rigorously**

**Theorem Recap (1.9-1.10):** Given a pre-measure $\mu_0$ on an algebra $\mathcal{A}$:
1. Extend to an outer measure $\mu^*$ via infimum over covers
2. Identify Carathéodory-measurable sets via the criterion $\mu^*(T) = \mu^*(T \cap E) + \mu^*(T \cap E^c)$
3. Restrict $\mu^*$ to the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{M}$ of measurable sets to obtain a true measure $\mu$

**RL Interpretation:** The transition kernel $P(\cdot | s,a)$ in continuous-state MDPs is constructed via Carathéodory:
- Start with probabilities on simple sets (rectangles): $P(R | s,a) = \int_R p(s' | s,a) \, ds'$
- Extend to all Borel sets via outer measure
- Carathéodory's theorem guarantees $P(\cdot | s,a)$ is a probability measure on $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{S}))$

This rigorous construction ensures that expectations $\mathbb{E}_{s' \sim P(\cdot|s,a)}[V(s')]$ are well-defined.

---

### **II. Computational Illustration: Discrete σ-Algebra Generator**

To build intuition, we implement a **discrete $\sigma$-algebra generator** for finite sets. Given a generating collection $\mathcal{G}$, we construct $\sigma(\mathcal{G})$ explicitly.

**Algorithm:** For a finite set $X = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$:
1. Start with $\mathcal{F}_0 = \mathcal{G} \cup \{\emptyset, X\}$
2. Iteratively close under complement and finite union until no new sets are added
3. For finite $X$, this terminates (since $|2^X| = 2^n < \infty$)

**Python Implementation:**

```python
import itertools
from typing import Set, FrozenSet

def sigma_algebra_generator(X: Set[int], generators: Set[FrozenSet[int]]) -> Set[FrozenSet[int]]:
    """
    Generate the smallest σ-algebra containing the generators.

    X_frozen = frozenset(X)

    sigma.update(generators)

    changed = True
    iterations = 0
    max_iterations = 1000  # Safety check for infinite loops

    while changed and iterations < max_iterations:
        iterations += 1
        new_sets = set()

        # Close under complement
        for A in sigma:
            complement = X_frozen - A
            if complement not in sigma:
                new_sets.add(complement)

            union = A | B

        if new_sets:
            sigma.update(new_sets)
        else:
            changed = False

    return sigma

```

**Remark (Algorithm Termination).** The `sigma_algebra_generator` algorithm is guaranteed to terminate for finite ground sets $X$. The $\sigma$-algebra $\sigma(\mathcal{G})$ is a subset of the power set $2^X$, which has $2^{|X|}$ elements. Each iteration either adds at least one new set to `sigma` or terminates (when `new_sets` is empty). Therefore, the number of iterations is bounded by $2^{|X|}$. For the examples above ($|X| \leq 6$), this bound is $2^6 = 64$ iterations, though in practice the algorithm terminates much faster due to the rapid closure under complements and unions.

For **infinite** ground sets $X$ (such as $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{N}$), this algorithm cannot be implemented directly—the $\sigma$-algebra $\sigma(\mathcal{G})$ is typically uncountable (e.g., $|\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})| = 2^{\aleph_0}$, the cardinality of the continuum). In such cases, we work with the $\sigma$-algebra **implicitly** through its generating sets (e.g., defining $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$ as $\sigma(\text{open sets})$ without enumerating all Borel sets).

**Expected Output Highlights:**

```
============================================================
EXAMPLE 2: σ-algebra generated by A = {1}
============================================================
Ground set X = [1, 2, 3]
σ-algebra has 4 sets:

   1. ∅
   2. [1]
   3. [2, 3]
   4. X = [1, 2, 3]

→ This is {∅, {1}, {2,3}, X}
→ Closure adds the complement {2,3} = A^c
```

```
============================================================
EXAMPLE 4: State space partitioned by 'good' vs 'bad' states
============================================================
Ground set X = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
σ-algebra has 4 sets:

   1. ∅
   2. [1, 2, 3]
   3. [4, 5, 6]
   4. X = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

→ In RL: If we can only observe whether state is 'good' or 'bad',
   the σ-algebra has only 4 sets: ∅, good, bad, X
→ A policy based on this σ-algebra treats all good states identically
```

**Interpretation:**

1. **Example 2** shows that the $\sigma$-algebra generated by a single set $A$ is $\{\emptyset, A, A^c, X\}$—the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing $A$. This is the **minimal observable structure** when we can only distinguish "$s \in A$" vs. "$s \notin A$".

2. **Example 4** (RL-inspired) demonstrates **coarse observability**. If an agent can only measure whether the state is "good" or "bad", it cannot implement policies that distinguish individual good states. The $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F} = \{\emptyset, \text{good}, \text{bad}, X\}$ constrains the policy class.

3. **Example 5** shows that **finer observations** (ability to distinguish region A from region B) enlarge the $\sigma$-algebra, enabling more refined policies. This is the mathematical formalization of "partial observability" in POMDPs.

### **III. Visualization: Set Operations and Carathéodory Measurability**

We now visualize the **Carathéodory measurability criterion** for a specific set.

**Definition 1.17 (Carathéodory Measurability Criterion).** Let $\mu^*$ be an outer measure on a set $X$. A set $E \subseteq X$ is called **$\mu^*$-measurable** (or simply measurable with respect to $\mu^*$) if for every test set $A \subseteq X$:
$$
\mu^*(A) = \mu^*(A \cap E) + \mu^*(A \cap E^c)
$$

**Geometric Interpretation:** $E$ "splits" every set $A$ additively. The outer measure of $A$ equals the sum of the outer measures of the parts inside and outside $E$.

**Visualization Code:**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.patches as mpatches
import numpy as np

def visualize_caratheodory_criterion():
    """
    Visualize Carathéodory's criterion geometrically in 2D.

**Output:**
- Three panels showing $E$, $A \cap E$, and $A \cap E^c$
- Numerical verification that $\lambda(A) = \lambda(A \cap E) + \lambda(A \cap E^c)$

**Interpretation:** The Carathéodory criterion is a **geometric additivity test**. A set $E$ is measurable if it decomposes every test set $A$ into two pieces ($A \cap E$ and $A \cap E^c$) whose measures add up to the measure of $A$. For rectangles (and all Borel sets), this holds by construction. For pathological sets (like Vitali sets), this fails—there is no consistent way to assign a measure.

### **IV. Application Bridge: σ-Algebras and Partial Observability in RL**

**Connection 1: Finite-State MDPs with Information Constraints**

Consider a gridworld with 16 states arranged in a 4$\times$4 grid. The agent can observe its exact position, so the $\sigma$-algebra is $\mathcal{F} = 2^{\mathcal{S}}$ (the power set—all subsets are observable).

Now suppose the agent has only a **coarse sensor** that reports which quadrant the agent is in (NW, NE, SW, SE). The $\sigma$-algebra is now:
$$
\mathcal{F}_{\text{coarse}} = \sigma(\{NW, NE, SW, SE\})
$$
This has only $2^4 = 16$ sets (compared to $2^{16} = 65536$ for full observability).

**Consequence:** A policy $\pi$ measurable with respect to $\mathcal{F}_{\text{coarse}}$ must assign the same action to all states in the same quadrant. This is the mathematical formalization of **partial observability**—the agent cannot implement policies that require finer distinctions.

**Connection 2: Continuous State Spaces and the Borel σ-Algebra**

For $\mathcal{S} = \mathbb{R}^n$ (e.g., joint angles of a robot arm), the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is generated by open sets. An agent can measure:
- Whether $s \in (a, b)$ (open interval)
- Whether $s \in \mathbb{R}^n \setminus K$ for closed $K$ (complement of closed set)
- Countable unions/intersections of such sets

But the agent **cannot** measure membership in non-Borel sets. This is not a practical limitation—physical sensors perform finite-precision measurements (e.g., "position within $[a - \epsilon, a + \epsilon]$"), which correspond to **closed intervals** and their countable unions/intersections. All such sets are Borel-measurable.

**Connection 3: POMDPs and Information Sets**

In a Partially Observable MDP (POMDP), the agent does not observe the true state $s \in \mathcal{S}$ but rather an observation $o \in \mathcal{O}$. The observation function $h: \mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{O}$ induces a $\sigma$-algebra on $\mathcal{S}$:
$$
\mathcal{F}_{\text{observable}} = \{h^{-1}(B) : B \subseteq \mathcal{O}\}
$$
A policy can depend only on the **belief state** $b(s) = \mathbb{P}(s | \text{history})$, which is $\mathcal{F}_{\text{observable}}$-measurable.

**Summary:** The $\sigma$-algebra structure is not an abstraction—it is the **information-theoretic constraint** on what policies can be implemented. Measurability is the requirement that decisions can be made based on observable information.

### **V. Reflection and Forward Connections**

**What We Have Achieved (Week 1):**

1. **Constructed the language of measurable spaces:** $\sigma$-algebras $\mathcal{F}$ define observable events, measures $\mu$ assign sizes/probabilities, measurable functions preserve structure.

2. **Established convergence machinery:** MCT, Fatou, DCT enable interchange of limits and expectations—the foundation of all iterative algorithms in RL.

3. **Proved rigor is not optional:** The Carathéodory extension shows that transition kernels on continuous spaces require this machinery. Non-measurable policies are mathematical fictions, not implementable in any physical system.

4. **Built computational intuition:** Discrete $\sigma$-algebra generators and Carathéodory visualizations make abstract concepts concrete.

### **Postponed Generalizations Log (Week 1)**

Throughout this week, we have occasionally proven results in simplified settings to respect time constraints while maintaining pedagogical clarity. The following table documents what was postponed, why, and when these generalizations become essential for RL applications.

| **What Was Postponed** | **Why Postponed** | **Where Proven** | **When It Matters for RL** |
|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Carathéodory Extension for general metric spaces | Initial treatment focused on $\mathbb{R}^n$ for concreteness | Day 4, Theorem 1.10 (proven for $\mathbb{R}^n$) | **Week 12**: General state-space MDPs (Polish spaces, Meyn-Tweedie) |
| π-λ Theorem: Full generality (arbitrary set systems) | Proved for algebras generated by π-systems; general case deferred | Day 1 exercises, Exercise 1 | **Week 6**: Conditional expectation on general filtrations |
| Radon-Nikodym Theorem for general $\sigma$-finite measures | Week 1 focused on Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ | Not yet covered | **Week 28**: Absolutely continuous policies in continuous action spaces |
| Convergence theorems for nets (beyond sequences) | Sequential convergence sufficient for $\mathbb{R}^n$ | Day 3, Theorems 1.6-1.8 | **Week 40**: Weak* convergence in measure-valued MDPs (mean-field games) |

**Important Notes:**

1. **Carathéodory on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is production-grade** for nearly all deep RL applications (Atari, robotics, continuous control). The general metric space version becomes necessary only for exotic state spaces (function-valued states, infinite-dimensional control).

2. **π-λ Theorem as stated** (Day 1, Exercise 1) is sufficient for all finite and countable state spaces, and for Borel $\sigma$-algebras on $\mathbb{R}^n$. The full generality is a measure-theoretic nicety rather than a practical necessity.

3. **Radon-Nikodym postponement** does not limit our ability to work with absolutely continuous measures in Weeks 2-24. We will encounter it naturally when studying policy parameterizations in continuous action spaces.

4. **Sequential convergence** is universal in computational RL (iterative algorithms, neural network training). Net-based convergence appears only in theoretical RL (convergence of empirical measures in the weak* topology).

This log will be updated weekly to maintain transparency about proof scope and mathematical rigor.

**Open Questions for Week 2:**

1. **Convergence in $L^p$ vs. pointwise:** When does $\int |f_n - f|^p \to 0$ imply $f_n \to f$ almost everywhere? (Answer: For subsequences, by Riesz-Fischer.)

2. **Completeness of $L^p$ spaces:** Why is completeness essential for defining value function spaces? (Answer: Fixed-point theorems require complete metric spaces.)

3. **Fubini's theorem:** When can we interchange the order of integration in double integrals? (Essential for computing expectations over product spaces, e.g., $\mathbb{E}_{s,s'}[\cdots]$.)

**Looking Ahead:**

- **Week 2:** $L^p$ spaces, Hölder/Minkowski inequalities, Riesz representation theorem. We will see that value functions naturally live in $L^\infty(\mathcal{S})$ (bounded functions with supremum norm).

- **Week 6:** Conditional expectation $\mathbb{E}[R | \mathcal{F}]$ as orthogonal projection in $L^2$. The tower property becomes the Bellman consistency equation.

- **Week 12:** Transition kernels on general state spaces (Meyn-Tweedie). Carathéodory's construction generalizes to product measures $\mu \times P(\cdot | s,a)$.

- **Week 25:** MDP formalism synthesizes everything: $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{F}, \mathcal{A}, P, R, \gamma)$ with measurability requirements throughout.

**The Central Thesis of Week 1:**

> Measure theory is not a prerequisite to RL—it **is** the mathematical language of RL. Without $\sigma$-algebras, we cannot define transition kernels. Without measurable functions, we cannot define policies. Without DCT, we cannot prove convergence of value iteration. Every algorithm, every theorem, every proof in RL theory rests on this foundation.

When we write $V^* = \max_\pi V^\pi$ or $\nabla J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}[\nabla \log \pi_\theta \cdot G]$, we are making statements that are rigorously meaningful only because of the measure-theoretic structure we have constructed this week.

This is not formalism for its own sake. It is the difference between mathematics and mythology.

## **Weekly Reflection (Week 1)**

### **Mathematical Insight**

This week established the foundational architecture of measure theory: **$\sigma$-algebras** provide the structure to rigorously define "events," **measures** quantify their size, and the **Monotone/Dominated Convergence Theorems** enable controlled interchange of limits and integrals. The **Carathéodory Extension Theorem** (proven here for $\mathbb{R}^n$) shows that specifying measures on simple sets (rectangles) uniquely determines measures on all Borel sets—a construction principle we will exploit throughout probability theory.

The key conceptual breakthrough is recognizing that the $\sigma$-algebra is not merely a mathematical artifact but the **formalization of observability**. A set $A \subseteq \mathcal{S}$ is in the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ if and only if an agent can, in principle, determine whether the current state belongs to $A$ through finite or countably infinite observations. Measurable functions are precisely those whose computation can be performed using only observable information.

### **RL Connection**

In RL, state and action spaces must be **measurable spaces** to define transition kernels $P(\cdot|s,a)$ and compute expectations $\mathbb{E}[R|s,a]$. The $\sigma$-algebra structure determines which sets of states are "observable" by the agent:
- In **discrete MDPs**, we typically use the power set $2^{\mathcal{S}}$ (full observability)
- In **continuous MDPs** ($\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$), we use the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{S})$
- In **POMDPs**, the $\sigma$-algebra is induced by the observation function, capturing partial observability

**Monotone Convergence** will underpin policy iteration (monotonic value function updates), while **Dominated Convergence** enables gradient interchange in policy gradient methods. The Carathéodory construction ensures that transition kernels on continuous spaces are well-defined probability measures, making the Bellman operator a rigorous mathematical object.

### **Open Questions**

1. **Infinite-Dimensional State Spaces:** How does the Carathéodory extension fail (or require modification) for infinite-dimensional state spaces, as in continuous control with function-valued states (e.g., controlling a distributed parameter system)? When do empirical measures from RL trajectories converge to true transition kernels—what regularity conditions are required?

2. **Non-σ-Finite Measures:** The uniqueness of Carathéodory's extension requires $\sigma$-finiteness. For MDPs with unbounded state spaces, is $\sigma$-finiteness always guaranteed? What happens if it fails? Can we still define meaningful value functions?

3. **Measurability of Optimal Policies:** We proved that measurable functions are closed under arithmetic and composition with continuous functions. But is the **argmax** operation measurable? That is, if $Q(s, \cdot): \mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{R}$ is measurable for each $s$, is $\pi^*(s) = \arg\max_a Q(s,a)$ a measurable function? (Hint: This requires the **Measurable Selection Theorem**, which states that if the argmax is taken over a compact set and the objective function is continuous, then a measurable selection exists. We will prove this in Week 25 when formalizing optimal policies.)

**End of Week 1 – Day 5**

📅 **Week 2 Preview:** We build the $L^p$ function spaces where value functions live, prove Hölder and Minkowski inequalities, establish the Riesz representation theorem for duality, and explore the geometry of these spaces through computational experiments. The journey from measure theory to functional analysis begins.
