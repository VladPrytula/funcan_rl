# Week 10 Architectural Plan: General State-Space Markov Chains

**Phase**: II (Markov Chains and Ergodic Theory)
**Primary References**: Meyn-Tweedie Ch 3-4, Norris Ch 2
**Prerequisites**: Week 1 (Carathéodory extension on $\mathbb{R}^n$), Week 2 (Product measures), Week 4 (Conditional expectation)

---

## Overview: Completing the Carathéodory Program

In Week 1, Day 4, we proved the **Carathéodory Extension Theorem** for $\mathbb{R}^n$, constructing Lebesgue measure rigorously from a pre-measure on rectangles. We postponed the general metric space version, noting:

> **Week 1 Postponed Generalization**: "Carathéodory on general metric spaces becomes necessary for **general state-space MDPs** (Polish spaces, Meyn-Tweedie). We will return to this in **Week 10**."

This week fulfills that promise. We extend Carathéodory's machinery from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to **arbitrary Polish spaces** (complete separable metric spaces), enabling rigorous treatment of:
- Markov chains on uncountable state spaces (e.g., $[0,1]$, $\mathbb{R}^d$)
- Transition kernels as measures on general measurable spaces
- Feller continuity and weak convergence of measures
- $\phi$-irreducibility and recurrence on general spaces

**Central Thesis**: The Carathéodory construction, proven for $\mathbb{R}^n$ in Week 1, generalizes to Polish spaces with minimal additional machinery. This unlocks the full Meyn-Tweedie theory required for continuous-state MDPs.

## Narrative Arc: From Week 1 to Week 10

### **What We Built (Week 1, Day 4)**
- **Theorem 1.10**: Carathéodory Extension on $\mathbb{R}^n$
  - Start with pre-measure $\mu_0$ on algebra $\mathcal{A}$ (rectangles)
  - Extend to outer measure $\mu^*$ via $\mu^*(E) = \inf \{\sum \mu_0(A_n) : E \subseteq \bigcup A_n\}$
  - Identify Carathéodory-measurable sets via criterion: $\mu^*(T) = \mu^*(T \cap E) + \mu^*(T \cap E^c)$
  - Restrict to $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{M}$ to obtain measure $\mu$

**Why $\mathbb{R}^n$ was sufficient**: Lebesgue measure, Gaussian densities, continuous control with bounded action spaces.

### **What We Need (Week 10)**
- **General Polish spaces**: Function spaces, infinite-dimensional state spaces, exotic MDPs
- **Transition kernels** $P: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{S}) \to [0,1]$ as objects requiring measurability in both arguments
- **Feller property**: Continuity of the transition operator on bounded continuous functions
- **Weak convergence**: Convergence of measures in the weak* topology (foreshadowing Week 12, Week 39)

**The Bridge**: Carathéodory's theorem holds verbatim on Polish spaces. The proof machinery from Week 1 transfers with only topological adjustments.

## Daily Breakdown (90 minutes/day)

### **Day 1 (Monday): Transition Kernels and Markov Operators**

**⏱️ Segment 1 (40 min) – Reading**

**Topic**: _Transition Kernels on General Measurable Spaces_

**Primary Reference**: Meyn-Tweedie §3.1-3.2

**Content**:
1. **Definition (Markov Kernel)**: A **transition kernel** on measurable space $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{F})$ is a function $P: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{F} \to [0,1]$ such that:
   - For each $s \in \mathcal{S}$: $P(s, \cdot)$ is a probability measure on $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{F})$
   - For each $A \in \mathcal{F}$: $P(\cdot, A)$ is $\mathcal{F}$-measurable

2. **Week 1 Callback**: Recall Day 5, the note on kernel measurability:
   > "For each fixed $(s,a)$, Carathéodory yields a probability measure $P(\cdot \mid s,a)$ on $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{S}))$. To obtain a Markov kernel, one also requires measurability of the parameter map: if the density $p(s' \mid s,a)$ is jointly measurable in $(s,a,s')$, then $(s,a) \mapsto P(B \mid s,a)$ is measurable for each Borel $B$."

   We now make this rigorous for general $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{F})$ beyond $\mathbb{R}^n$.

3. **Markov Operator on Bounded Functions**:
   $$
   (Pf)(s) = \int_{\mathcal{S}} f(s') \, P(s, ds')
   $$
   - **Domain**: $f \in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{S})$ (bounded $\mathcal{F}$-measurable functions)
   - **Codomain**: $Pf \in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{S})$ (by dominated convergence)
   - **Operator norm**: $\|P\|_{\mathcal{B}} = \sup_{\|f\|_\infty \leq 1} \|Pf\|_\infty = 1$ (since $P$ is sub-Markov)

4. **Connection to Week 1 DCT**: The interchange
   $$
   \lim_{n \to \infty} \int f_n \, dP(s, \cdot) = \int \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n \, dP(s, \cdot)
   $$
   follows from **Dominated Convergence Theorem** (Week 1, Day 3, Theorem 1.8). If $|f_n| \leq g \in L^1(P(s, \cdot))$, then:
   $$
   \lim_n (Pf_n)(s) = (P(\lim_n f_n))(s)
   $$

**⏱️ Segment 2 (40 min) – Proof Exercise**

**Exercise 10.1 (Markov Operator Preserves Measurability)**:

Prove that if $f: \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}$ is $\mathcal{F}$-measurable and bounded, then $Pf$ is $\mathcal{F}$-measurable.

**Proof**:
Let $f$ be $\mathcal{F}$-measurable and bounded. We must show $(Pf)^{-1}(B) \in \mathcal{F}$ for all Borel $B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

**Step 1**: Write $Pf$ as a limit of simple functions.

Since $f$ is bounded and measurable, it is the pointwise limit of simple functions $f_n = \sum_{k=1}^{K_n} a_k^{(n)} \mathbf{1}_{A_k^{(n)}}$ with $A_k^{(n)} \in \mathcal{F}$.

For each $n$:
$$
(Pf_n)(s) = \sum_{k=1}^{K_n} a_k^{(n)} P(s, A_k^{(n)})
$$

Since $P(\cdot, A_k^{(n)})$ is $\mathcal{F}$-measurable (by definition of kernel), each $Pf_n$ is a finite linear combination of measurable functions, hence measurable.

**Step 2**: Apply DCT to justify $Pf_n \to Pf$.

Since $|f_n| \leq \|f\|_\infty < \infty$ and $P(s, \cdot)$ is a probability measure:
$$
|(Pf_n)(s)| \leq \int |f_n| \, dP(s, \cdot) \leq \|f\|_\infty
$$

By DCT (Week 1, Day 3):
$$
(Pf)(s) = \lim_n (Pf_n)(s)
$$

**Step 3**: Conclude measurability.

The pointwise limit of measurable functions is measurable (Week 1, Proposition 1.3). Therefore $Pf$ is $\mathcal{F}$-measurable. □

**Remark**: This proof directly applies Week 1 machinery (DCT, closure under limits). The generality from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to arbitrary $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{F})$ is automatic.

**⏱️ Segment 3 (10 min) – Reflection**

**Conceptual Question**: How does the Markov operator $P$ relate to the Bellman operator $T$ in MDPs?

**Answer Preview**: In Week 23, we will see that the Bellman operator for value functions is:
$$
(TV)(s) = \max_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \left\{ R(s,a) + \gamma \int V(s') \, P(ds' \mid s,a) \right\}
$$
The integral is precisely the Markov operator applied to $V$. The Feller property (Day 2-3) will ensure $TV$ maps continuous functions to continuous functions, enabling fixed-point theorems.

---

### **Day 2 (Tuesday): Feller Property and Continuity**

**⏱️ Segment 1 (40 min) – Reading**

**Topic**: _Feller Continuity and the $C_b(X)$ Operator Topology_

**Primary Reference**: Meyn-Tweedie §3.3, Norris §2.5

**Content**:
1. **Definition (Feller Kernel)**: A transition kernel $P$ on Polish space $(X, \rho)$ is **Feller** if:
   $$
   P: C_b(X) \to C_b(X)
   $$
   i.e., $Pf$ is bounded and continuous whenever $f$ is bounded and continuous.

   Here $C_b(X) = \{f: X \to \mathbb{R} : f \text{ continuous and bounded}\}$ with sup norm $\|f\|_\infty = \sup_{x \in X} |f(x)|$.

2. **Why Feller Matters for RL**:
   - **Value function continuity**: If the transition kernel is Feller and the reward $R$ is continuous, then the Bellman operator $T$ maps $C_b(\mathcal{S})$ to itself. This ensures optimal value functions $V^*$ are continuous (Week 24).
   - **Approximation**: Neural networks approximate continuous functions well (universal approximation). If $V^*$ is discontinuous, function approximation fails catastrophically.
   - **Weak convergence**: Feller property is equivalent to weak continuity in initial distributions (Theorem 10.2, Thursday).

3. **Example (Gaussian Kernel)**: On $X = \mathbb{R}$, define
   $$
   P(x, dy) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(y-x)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) dy
   $$
   (Gaussian random walk: $X_{n+1} = X_n + \varepsilon_n$, $\varepsilon_n \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$)

   **Claim**: This kernel is Feller.

   **Proof Sketch**: For $f \in C_b(\mathbb{R})$:
   $$
   (Pf)(x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} f(y) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-(y-x)^2/(2\sigma^2)} dy
   $$
   - **Boundedness**: $|(Pf)(x)| \leq \|f\|_\infty \cdot \int p(y-x) dy = \|f\|_\infty$
   - **Continuity**: For $x_n \to x$, the dominated convergence theorem (Week 1, Day 3) with dominating function $g(y) = |f(y)| \cdot \sup_z p(y-z)$ (integrable since $p$ has exponential decay) yields:
     $$
     \lim_n (Pf)(x_n) = \int f(y) \lim_n p(y - x_n) dy = \int f(y) p(y - x) dy = (Pf)(x)
     $$

   Therefore $Pf \in C_b(\mathbb{R})$. □

4. **Non-Feller Example (Discontinuous Jump)**: We now exhibit a kernel on $X = [0,1]$ that fails the Feller property.

   Define
   $$
   P(x, A) = \begin{cases}
   \delta_0(A) & x \in (0,1] \\
   \delta_{1/2}(A) & x = 0
   \end{cases}
   $$
   For the continuous function $f(x)=x$, we obtain
   $$
   (Pf)(x) = \begin{cases}
   0 & x \in (0,1] \\
   1/2 & x=0
   \end{cases}
   $$
   which is discontinuous at $x=0$. Hence $P$ is not Feller. This illustrates that discontinuous dependence of $P(x,\cdot)$ on $x$ destroys continuity of the Markov operator.

**⏱️ Segment 2 (40 min) – Proof Exercise**

**Exercise 10.2 (Feller Property for Gaussian Random Walk)**:

Verify that the Gaussian kernel
$$
P(x, dy) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(y-x)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) dy
$$
on $\mathbb{R}$ is Feller. Specifically, prove that if $f \in C_b(\mathbb{R})$, then $Pf \in C_b(\mathbb{R})$.

[Full proof as sketched above, with all DCT details filled in.]

**⏱️ Segment 3 (10 min) – Reflection**

**Question**: Why does Feller property fail for some kernels?

**Answer**: Feller requires the kernel to "smooth" functions. Kernels with jumps or atoms can map continuous functions to discontinuous ones. The Gaussian kernel smooths because it's a convolution with a continuous density.

### **Day 3 (Wednesday): $\phi$-Irreducibility and Recurrence**

**⏱️ Segment 1 (40 min) – Reading**

**Topic**: _Irreducibility on General State Spaces_

**Primary Reference**: Meyn-Tweedie §4.1-4.2

**Content**:
1. **Finite-State Irreducibility (Week 7 Recall)**: A finite Markov chain is **irreducible** if all states communicate: for all $i, j$, there exists $n$ with $P^n(i, j) > 0$.

2. **Problem for Uncountable Spaces**: On $\mathcal{S} = [0,1]$, individual points have measure zero under smooth kernels. The event "$X_n$ ever hits $x$" has probability zero for any $x$.

   **Solution**: Replace "hitting individual states" with "hitting positive-measure sets."

3. **Definition ($\phi$-Irreducibility)**: Let $\phi$ be a **reference measure** on $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{F})$ (typically Lebesgue measure).

   A Markov chain is **$\phi$-irreducible** if for all $A \in \mathcal{F}$ with $\phi(A) > 0$, there exists $n \geq 1$ such that:
   $$
   P^n(x, A) > 0 \quad \text{for all } x \in \mathcal{S}
   $$

   **Intuition**: Every "substantial" set $A$ (substantial = $\phi(A) > 0$) is reachable from anywhere in finitely many steps.

4. **Example (Gaussian Random Walk on $\mathbb{R}$)**:
   $$
   P(x, dy) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-(y-x)^2/(2\sigma^2)} dy
   $$

   **Claim**: This chain is $\phi$-irreducible for $\phi = $ Lebesgue measure.

   **Proof**: For any open interval $A = (a, b)$ with $\phi(A) = b - a > 0$:
   $$
   P(x, A) = \int_a^b \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-(y-x)^2/(2\sigma^2)} dy > 0
   $$
   since the Gaussian density is strictly positive everywhere. Thus $n = 1$ suffices. □

5. **Recurrence on General Spaces**: A set $A$ is **recurrent** if
   $$
   \mathbb{P}_x(\text{chain returns to } A \text{ infinitely often}) = 1 \quad \text{for all } x \in A
   $$

   **Harris recurrence** (Week 9): All $\phi$-substantial sets are recurrent.

**⏱️ Segment 2 (40 min) – Proof Exercise**

**Exercise 10.3 (Anchor: $\phi$-Irreducibility for Finite Chains)**:

Let $\mathcal{S} = \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$ (finite state space) with transition matrix $P$. Define $\phi$ as **counting measure** on $\mathcal{S}$ (i.e., $\phi(A) = |A|$).

Prove: The chain is irreducible (in the classical sense: all states communicate) if and only if it is $\phi$-irreducible.

**Proof**:
[To be filled in by student, but outline: $\phi(A) > 0 \iff A \neq \emptyset$. For irreducible chain, $P^n(i,j) > 0$ for some $n$ and all $i,j$. Thus for any non-empty $A$, pick $j \in A$; then $P^n(i, A) \geq P^n(i, j) > 0$.]

**⏱️ Segment 3 (10 min) – Reflection**

**Question**: Why is $\phi$-irreducibility the "right" generalization of irreducibility?

**Answer**: On uncountable spaces, hitting individual points has probability zero. The reference measure $\phi$ identifies which sets are "large enough" to serve as recurrence targets. For Lebesgue measure, this means non-empty open sets.

---

### **Day 4 (Thursday): Weak Convergence and Feller Equivalence (Extended Proof)**

**⏱️ Segment 1 (30 min) – Theorem Statement**

**Theorem 10.2 (Feller $\iff$ Weak Continuity)**:

Let $P$ be a transition kernel on Polish space $(X, \mathcal{B}(X))$. The following are equivalent:

1. **Feller property**: $P: C_b(X) \to C_b(X)$

2. **Weak continuity**: For all $\mu_n \Rightarrow \mu$ (weak convergence of measures), we have $\mu_n P \Rightarrow \mu P$, where
   $$
   (\mu P)(A) = \int P(x, A) \, \mu(dx)
   $$

**Intuition**: Feller continuity in space $\iff$ continuity in measure space.

**⏱️ Segment 2 (60 min) – Proof of Theorem 10.2**

**Proof**:

**(1) $\Rightarrow$ (2)**: Assume $P$ is Feller. Let $\mu_n \Rightarrow \mu$ weakly.

To show $\mu_n P \Rightarrow \mu P$, we must verify that for all $f \in C_b(X)$:
$$
\int f \, d(\mu_n P) \to \int f \, d(\mu P)
$$

**Step 1**: Rewrite using kernel definition.
$$
\int f(y) \, (\mu_n P)(dy) = \int \left(\int f(y) \, P(x, dy)\right) \mu_n(dx) = \int (Pf)(x) \, \mu_n(dx)
$$

Similarly:
$$
\int f(y) \, (\mu P)(dy) = \int (Pf)(x) \, \mu(dx)
$$

**Step 2**: Apply Feller property.

Since $f \in C_b(X)$ and $P$ is Feller, $Pf \in C_b(X)$.

**Step 3**: Apply weak convergence.

Since $\mu_n \Rightarrow \mu$ and $Pf \in C_b(X)$:
$$
\int (Pf)(x) \, \mu_n(dx) \to \int (Pf)(x) \, \mu(dx)
$$

Therefore:
$$
\int f \, d(\mu_n P) \to \int f \, d(\mu P)
$$

Thus $\mu_n P \Rightarrow \mu P$. □

**(2) $\Rightarrow$ (1)**: Assume weak continuity. Let $f \in C_b(X)$. We must show $Pf \in C_b(X)$.

**Step 1**: Boundedness is easy.
$$
|(Pf)(x)| \leq \int |f| \, dP(x, \cdot) \leq \|f\|_\infty
$$

**Step 2**: Prove continuity of $Pf$.

Fix $x \in X$. We must show: if $x_n \to x$, then $(Pf)(x_n) \to (Pf)(x)$.

Consider the **Dirac measures** $\delta_{x_n}$ and $\delta_x$. In a Polish space, $x_n \to x$ implies $\delta_{x_n} \Rightarrow \delta_x$ weakly (standard fact from measure theory).

By weak continuity hypothesis:
$$
\delta_{x_n} P \Rightarrow \delta_x P
$$

But:
$$
\int f \, d(\delta_{x_n} P) = \int (Pf)(y) \, \delta_{x_n}(dy) = (Pf)(x_n)
$$

Similarly:
$$
\int f \, d(\delta_x P) = (Pf)(x)
$$

Since $f \in C_b(X)$ is arbitrary, applying weak convergence:
$$
(Pf)(x_n) = \int f \, d(\delta_{x_n} P) \to \int f \, d(\delta_x P) = (Pf)(x)
$$

Therefore $Pf$ is continuous. □

**Remark**: This theorem is the Rosetta Stone connecting operator continuity (functional analysis, Week 12-13) with measure-theoretic continuity (weak topology, Week 12). It will reappear in Week 39 (mean-field games) when we study convergence of empirical measures.

### **Day 5 (Friday): Computational Synthesis**

**⏱️ Segment 1 (20 min) – Review**

Recap the week:
1. Transition kernels as measurable maps
2. Markov operator $P: \mathcal{B}(X) \to \mathcal{B}(X)$ and $P: C_b(X) \to C_b(X)$
3. Feller property ensures value functions stay continuous
4. $\phi$-irreducibility generalizes finite-state irreducibility

**⏱️ Segment 2 (30 min) – Proof Review**

Review Exercise 10.2 (Gaussian kernel is Feller) and Theorem 10.2 (Feller $\iff$ weak continuity).

**⏱️ Segment 3 (40 min) – Coding Synthesis**

**Implementation**: Simulate a Markov chain with Gaussian kernel on $[0,1]$ with reflecting boundaries.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def gaussian_kernel_reflect(x, sigma=0.1):
    """
    Sample from Gaussian kernel with reflection at [0,1] boundaries.

    K(x, dy) = N(y; x, σ²) truncated and renormalized to [0,1]
    """
    # Propose Gaussian step
    y = np.random.normal(x, sigma)

    # Reflect at boundaries
    while y < 0 or y > 1:
        if y < 0:
            y = -y
        if y > 1:
            y = 2 - y

    return y

# Simulate chain
T = 1000
sigma = 0.1
x0 = 0.5
trajectory = [x0]

for t in range(T-1):
    trajectory.append(gaussian_kernel_reflect(trajectory[-1], sigma))

# Visualize
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 5))

# Panel 1: Trajectory

plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('week10_gaussian_kernel.png', dpi=150)
plt.show()

print("Feller property verification:")
print("→ Kernel is continuous (Gaussian density)")
print("→ Maps C_b([0,1]) → C_b([0,1])")
print("→ Empirically near-uniform under symmetric reflection; φ-irreducibility alone does not imply uniformity")
```

**Expected Output**: Trajectory shows ergodic exploration of $[0,1]$; histogram approximates uniform distribution.

**RL Connection**: This kernel structure appears in continuous-action policy gradients (Week 37), where actions are sampled from Gaussian policies $\pi(a \mid s) = N(a; \mu_\theta(s), \sigma^2)$.
